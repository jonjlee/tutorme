The classic form involves\nprior sensitization to an allergen with later re-exposure, producing symptoms\nvia an immunologic mechanism. The most common organ systems involved include\nthe cutaneous, respiratory, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal systems. The\nfull-blown syndrome includes urticaria (hives) and/or angioedema with\nhypotension and bronchospasm.\n <span>\n  &nbsp;\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Traditionally, the term\n&ldquo;anaphylaxis&rdquo; is reserved for reactions mediated by immunoglobulin E (IgE), and\nthe term &ldquo;anaphylactoid&rdquo; is reserved for IgE-independent events (which are\nclinically indistinguishable). Anaphylaxis is a type I hypersensitivity response.\nIgE production requires the secretion of cytokines from T\n <sub>\n  H\n </sub>\n 2 cells.\nThese cytokines induce B cells to switch antibody production to the IgE\nclass.\n <span>\n  &nbsp;\n </span>\n The IgE binds to Fc\uf065\nreceptors on mast cells. When the antigen-binding region of IgE is cross-linked\nby allergens, mast cell degranulation occurs, resulting in anaphylaxis.\n <span>\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The physiologic responses to\nthe release of anaphylaxis mediators include smooth muscle spasm in the\nrespiratory and gastrointestinal (GI) tracts, vasodilation, increased vascular\npermeability, and stimulation of sensory nerve endings. Increased mucous\nsecretion and increased bronchial smooth muscle tone, as well as airway edema,\ncontribute to the respiratory symptoms. Cardiovascular effects result from\ndecreased vascular tone and capillary leakage. Hypotension, cardiac\narrhythmias, syncope, and shock may result from intravascular volume loss,\nvasodilation, and myocardial dysfunction. These physiologic events lead to some\nor all of the classic symptoms of anaphylaxis: flushing; urticaria/angioedema;\npruritus; bronchospasm; laryngeal edema; abdominal cramping with nausea,\nvomiting, and diarrhea; and feeling of impending doom.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Anaphylaxis is a medical\nemergency that requires immediate recognition and intervention. Patients should\nreceive high-flow oxygen, cardiac monitoring, and intravenous access.\nEpinephrine maintains blood pressure, antagonizes the effects of the released mediators,\nand inhibits further release of mediators. Use of epinephrine for anaphylaxis\nhas no absolute contraindications. It is the drug of choice and it is usually\nwell tolerated and potentially lifesaving.

Gout is definitively diagnosed by demonstration\nof urate crystals in aspirated synovial fluid.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Acute monoarticular\narthritis is the initial presentation in 90% of patients. Podagra, inflammation\nof the first metatarsophalangeal joint, is the initial joint manifestation in\n50% of cases (Figure 1). The attack begins abruptly and reaches maximum\nintensity within 8-12 hours. The joint is red, hot, and exquisitely tender;\neven a bed sheet on the swollen joint is uncomfortable. Untreated, the first\nattack resolves spontaneously in less than 2 weeks. Acute flares of gout can be\nprecipitated by events that raise serum uric acid levels, such as consumption\nof beer or liquor, overconsumption of high-purine foods, trauma, hemorrhage,\ndehydration, or the use of medications that raise uric acid levels (e.g.,\nthiazide diuretics).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Patients with gout are much\nmore likely to develop renal stones than are healthy individuals (by a factor\nof 1000). Although patients with gout often have other risk factors for renal\ndisease (e.g., hypertension and diabetes), chronic urate nephropathy can itself\ncontribute to renal insufficiency. Although gout typically causes joint\ninflammation, it can also cause inflammation of bursae and tendons. Tophi are\ncollections of urate crystals in the soft tissues. They can develop in patients\nwith untreated gout and may appear as lumps or nodules. While the classic\nlocation of tophi is along the helix of the ear, they can be found in other\nlocations, such as the fingers, toes, and olecranon bursae.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Gout is managed in three\nstages: (1) treating the acute attack, (2) providing prophylaxis to prevent\nacute flares, and (3) lowering excess stores of urate to prevent gouty flares\nand tissue deposition of urate crystals.

The past decade has\nseen an unprecedented change in the treatment paradigm for this disease.\nSeveral targeted biologic therapies are available; the most notable are the\nanti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapies.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"8\" width=\"100%\">\n <tr>\n  <td width=\"96%\">\n   <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n    <tr>\n     <td width=\"100%\">\n      <p>\n       <b>\n        <span>\n         Clinical Features\n        </span>\n       </b>\n      </p>\n     </td>\n    </tr>\n   </table>\n   <p>\n    <span>\n    </span>\n   </p>\n   <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\">\n    <tr>\n     <td width=\"100%\">\n      <p>\n       <a name=\"P079010\">\n       </a>\n       <span>\n        RA is a symmetrical\n    polyarthritis typically involving the small joints of the hands and feet,\n    the wrists, and the ankles.

First, insoluble calcium salts (primarily\nhydroxyapatite) provide the structural characteristics that allow bones to\nprotect internal organs, to bear weight, and to function as the levers on which\nmuscles act during locomotion. Second, soluble calcium ions in the\nextracellular fluid (ECF) and cytosol are critical for a myriad of biochemical\nreactions, signaling cascades, and electrical systems that are necessary for\nlife.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Most of the calcium in the body (about 99%) is found in\nbone. Only 1% is contained within the ECF and soft tissues. Therefore, the\nskeleton is called on as a source of calcium when the ECF concentration falls.\nOf the total circulating calcium, the ionized fraction is about 50%, with the\nremainder bound to serum proteins, primarily albumin. Only the ionized fraction\nof total serum calcium is physiologically important, and this component is\nregulated on a minute-to-minute basis.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Hormones and organ systems regulate\nthe ECF ionized calcium concentration such that it is maintained in a very\nnarrow physiologic range. If the calcium level falls below the physiologic\nrange, PTH is rapidly secreted from the parathyroid glands and activates the\nrelease of calcium and phosphate from the skeleton. In the kidney, PTH\nincreases the reabsorption of calcium from the urine while simultaneously\ninhibiting phosphate reabsorption to dispose\n <a name=\"4-u1.0-B978-1-4160-2805-5..50271-8--p189\">\n </a>\n of the phosphate released\nfrom the skeleton.

The dead\ncell and its fragments are rapidly devoured, before the contents have leaked\nout, and therefore cell death by this pathway does not elicit an inflammatory\nreaction in the host.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Apoptosis\nis a unique mechanism of cell death, distinct from necrosis.

The five major types of\nadaptation are atrophy, hypertrophy, hyperplasia, dysplasia, and metaplasia.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <b>\n  Atrophy\n </b>\n is a decrease\nin cell size. If enough cells in an organ atrophy, the entire organ will\ndecrease in size. Thymus atrophy in childhood is an example of physiologic\natrophy. Skeletal muscle atrophy is a pathologic adaptation to skeletal muscle\ndisuse. Tissue and organs especially susceptible to atrophy include skeletal\nmuscle, cardiac muscle, secondary sex organs, and the brain.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <b>\n  Hypertrophy\n </b>\n is an\nincrease in cell size. If enough cells of an organ hypertrophy, the organ\nitself will enlarge. The heart and kidneys are especially susceptible to\nhypertrophy. Hypertrophy may be caused by mechanial signals (e.g., stretch) or\ntrophic signals (e.g., growth factors). Physiologic hypertrophy occurs in\nskeletal muscle with sustained weight-bearing exercise. Pathologic hypertrophy\noccurs in cardiac muscle as a result of hypertension.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <b>\n  Hyperplasia\n </b>\n is an\nincrease in the number of cells due to increased cell mitosis. Physiologic\nhyperplasia may be compensatory or hormonal. Compensatory hyperplasia permits\ntissue and organ regeneration. It is common in epithelial cells of the\nepidermis and intestine, hepatocytes, bone marrow cells, and fibroblasts.\nHormonal hyperplasia occurs mainly in organs that depend on estrogen (e.g.,\nendometrial cells during pregnancy). Pathologic hyperplasia is an abnormal\nincrease in cell division (e.g., endometriosis).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <b>\n  Metaplasia\n </b>\n occurs\nwhen a differentiated cell type is replaced by another cell type, which may be\nless differentiated. It is a reversible process. Metaplasia occurs in the\nrespiratory tract as a response to smoking. Bronchial cells convert from\nmucus-secreting, ciliated, columnar epithelium to non-mucous-secreting,\nnon-ciliated, squamous epithelium. The cells may become dysplasic or cancerous\nif the stimulus (e.g., cigarette smoking) is not removed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <b>\n  Dysplasia\n </b>\n refers to\nabnormal changes in cellular shape, size, and organization. Sometimes called\n\"atypical hyperplasia,&rdquo; dysplasia is not a true adaptation but, rather,\nthe earliest pre-cancerous lesion recognizable in a biopsy. Tissues prone to\ndysplasia include cervical and respiratory epithelia. Dysplasia can be mild (low-grade),\nmoderate, or severe (high-grade). Mild dysplasia is at low risk of transforming\ninto cancer. Severe dysplasia is at high risk. In most organs, carcinoma\n <i>\n  in situ\n </i>\n (CIS) is synonmyous with severe\n(high-grade) dysplasia. CIS immediately precedes the development of frank\ncarcinoma and resembles invasive carcinoma except for the lack of basement\nmembrane disruption.\n <span>\n  &nbsp;\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span a=\"\" and=\"\" by=\"\" changes=\"\" characterized=\"\" constellation=\"\" encountered=\"\" epithelia=\"\" in=\"\" is=\"\" it=\"\" of=\"\" principally=\"\" that=\"\">\n  include\na loss in the uniformity of the individual cells as well as a loss in their\narchitectural orientation\n </span>\n . Dysplastic cells exhibit considerable\npleomorphism and often contain large hyperchromatic nuclei with a high\nnuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio. The architecture of the tissue may be disorderly.\nFor example, in squamous epithelium the usual progressive maturation of tall\ncells in the basal layer to flattened squamous cells on the surface may be lost\nand replaced by a scrambling of dark basal-appearing cells throughout the epithelium.\nMitotic figures are more abundant than usual. Frequently, they appear in\nabnormal locations within the epithelium. For example, in dysplastic stratified\nsquamous epithelium, mitoses are not confined to the basal layers but instead\nmay appear at all levels, including surface cells. When dysplastic changes are\nmarked and involve the entire thickness of the epithelium but the lesion\nremains confined by the basement membrane, it is considered a preinvasive\nneoplasm and is referred to as\n <i>\n  carcinoma in situ\n </i>\n . Once the tumor cells\nbreach the basement membrane, the tumor is said to be\n <i>\n  invasive\n </i>\n .\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n Photomicrographs\nof normal respiratory epithelium appear below.\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n <span>\n  <img alt=\"Description: respiratory epithelium\" border=\"0\" height=\"307\" src=\"_%20Tutorials_files/image048.png\" v:shapes=\"Picture_x0020_347184\" width=\"247\"/>\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n <span>\n  <img alt=\"Description: respiratory epithelium 2\" border=\"0\" height=\"264\" src=\"_%20Tutorials_files/image050.png\" v:shapes=\"Picture_x0020_347183\" width=\"353\"/>\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Respiratory epithelium\nlining the upper airways is classified as\n <i>\n  ciliated pseudostratified columnar\nepithelium.\n </i>\n Although all cells in the epithelium touch the basement\nmembrane and, therefore, comprise a single layer, the nuclei are not aligned in\nthe same plane. Thus, the epithelium appears to have several layers. The term\n&ldquo;pseudostratified&rdquo; describes this arrangement.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The majority of cells\ncomposing the\n <i>\n  ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium\n </i>\n are of three\ntypes: a) ciliated cells, b) goblet cells, and c) basal cells. The ciliated\ncells are columnar epithelial cells with specialized ciliary modifications.\nGoblet cells, so named because they are shaped like a wine goblet, are columnar\nepithelial cells that secrete mucus. The basal cells are small, nearly cuboidal\ncells that differentiate into other cells types. They respond to epithelial\ninjury by migrating to the denuded site and differentiating to restore the\nepithelial cell layer.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Some of the earliest changes\nin smoking-damaged respiratory epithelium include goblet cell hyperplasia\n <b>\n  (A)\n </b>\n ,\nbasal cell hyperplasia\n <b>\n  (B)\n </b>\n , and squamous metaplasia\n <b>\n  (C)\n </b>\n .

The syndrome is usually associated with impaired cognitive\nability and physical growth. Features include small chin, round face, big\ntongue, almond-shapes eyes, upslanting palpebral fissures, short limbs, a\nsingle transverse palmar crease, poor muscle tone, and a larger than normal\nspace between the big and second toes. Affected individuals are at higher risk\nof congenital heart defects, gastroesophageal reflux disease, recurrent ear\ninfections, obstructive sleep apnea, and thyroid dysfunction. Three cytogenetic\nvariants cause Down syndrome: trisomy 21, chromosomal translocation, and\nmosaicism.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <i>\n  <span>\n   Trisomy 21\n  </span>\n </i>\n <span>\n  accounts for nearly 95% of all patients\nwith Down syndrome and is due to meiotic nondisjunction. With nondisjunction, a\ngamete (\n  <span>\n   i.e.\n  </span>\n  , a sperm or egg\ncell) is produced with an extra copy of chromosome 21; the gamete thus has 24\nchromosomes. When combined with a normal gamete from the other parent, the\nembryo now has 47 chromosomes, with three copies of chromosome 21. The\nlikelihood of nondisjunction in the mother increases with maternal age.\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;\n  </span>\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <i>\n  Robertsonian translocation\n </i>\n in one of the parents is responsible for\n2-3% of Down cases. The long arm of chromosome 21 becomes attached to another\nchromosome, often chromosome 14. A person with such a translocation is phenotypically\nnormal. During reproduction, normal disjunctions have a significant chance of\ncreating a gamete with an extra chromosome 21, producing a child with Down\nsyndrome. &ldquo;Translocation Down syndrome&rdquo; is often referred to as &ldquo;\n <span>\n  familial Down syndrome\n </span>\n .&rdquo;\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <i>\n  <span>\n   Mosaicism\n  </span>\n </i>\n <span>\n  explains 1-2% of Down cases. In mosaic Down,\nsome cells in the body are normal and others have trisomy 21. This is due to\nmitotic nondisjunction during an early cell division in a normal embryo.\nIndividuals with mosaic Down have a normal cell line and usually milder\nphysical stigmata.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <b>\n  Turner syndrome\n </b>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Turner syndrome\n </span>\n encompasses several conditions, of which monosomy\nX (absence of an entire sex chromosome, the Barr body) is most common.

The products of\nthese processes are free fatty acids and amino acids, respectively. Free fatty\nacids are converted to acetyl-CoA, some of which is diverted to produce\nketones. Amino acids are used to synthesize new glucose-6-phosphate in liver\ncells by the process of gluconeogenesis.

The three\nmost important responses are\n <i>\n  glycogenolysis\n </i>\n ,\n <i>\n  gluconeogenesis\n </i>\n , and\n <i>\n  fatty acid oxidation.\n </i>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  When the body is denied glucose for more\nthan 4 hours, hepatic glycogen is used for fuel. Through glycogenolysis,\nglycogen is broken down to glucose monomers. The liver contains about 12 hours\nworth of glycogen. When hepatic glycogen is depleted, three events occur. 1)\nMuscle glycogen is broken down, which may continue for days. 2) Gluconeogenesis\noccurs, in which glucose is generated from non-carbohydrate substrates. 3)\nLipolysis occurs, in which fats (triglycerides) are broken down into glycerol\nand fatty acids.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Each triglyceride molecule is composed of\none glycerol and three fatty acid molecules. Fatty acids are transported from\nthe cytosol to the mitochondria by carnitine (a quaternary ammonium compound).\nIn the mitochondria, fatty acids are broken down through beta-oxidation to\nproduce acetyl CoA, which enters the Krebs cycle to produce energy. If fatty\nacid breakdown is excessive, the Krebs cycle is overwhelmed and &ldquo;extra&rdquo; acetyl\nCoA is used to produce ketones, which the brain uses for energy. (The brain\ncannot use fatty acids directly because they do not cross the blood-brain\nbarrier.)\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  The three metabolic responses to\nhypoglycemia are regulated by hormones. As glucose levels drop, insulin\nsecretion is suppressed and counter-regulatory hormone secretion is enhanced.\nCounter-regulatory hormones (glucagon, epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol,\nand growth hormone) oppose insulin action.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Hypoglycemia may be ketotic or\nnon-ketotic. Ketones are formed by fatty acid oxidation. The principal ketones\nare acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate. Prolonged fasting causes ketosis\nbecause a fall in blood glucose triggers lipolysis, fatty acid oxidation, and\nketone production. In patients with disorders that impede fatty acid oxidation,\nketone production will be impaired. These patients will develop a non-ketotic\nhypoglycemia.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  The infant in this vignette has\n  <i>\n   non-ketotic\n  </i>\n  hypoglycemia, suggesting a disorder of fatty acid oxidation. Of the five\ninherited metabolic disorders listed, only one represents a disorder of fatty\nacid metabolism: medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n <span>\n  <img border=\"0\" height=\"365\" src=\"_%20Tutorials_files/image108.png\" v:shapes=\"Picture_x0020_347154\" width=\"430\"/>\n </span>\n <span>\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n <span>\n  Glycolysis\nand Gluconeogenesis\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  <img border=\"0\" height=\"427\" src=\"_%20Tutorials_files/image110.png\" v:shapes=\"Picture_x0020_347153\" width=\"424\"/>\n </span>\n <span>\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n <span>\n  <img alt=\"Description: FA-Ox\" border=\"0\" height=\"275\" src=\"_%20Tutorials_files/image112.png\" v:shapes=\"Picture_x0020_347152\" width=\"415\"/>\n </span>\n <span>\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n <span>\n  Ketogenesis\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n <span>\n  <img alt=\"Description: Ketogenesis\" border=\"0\" height=\"417\" src=\"_%20Tutorials_files/image114.png\" v:shapes=\"Picture_x0020_347151\" width=\"313\"/>\n </span>\n <span>\n </span>\n</p>\n", "choices": ["A.

Thus, the first amino\n  acid to be altered is amino acid 11, indicating that the mutation must be in\n  codon 11 (which codes for amino acid 11). Could this mutation be a\n  substitution? Consider the following: If a silent mutation had occurred, the\n  amino acid sequence would not have changed. If a missense mutation had\n  occurred, amino acid 11 would have changed, but amino acids 12-20 would have\n  been the same.

(If the number were divisible by three, the reading frame\n  would not have &ldquo;shifted.&rdquo;) The answer is, therefore, B (i.e., a deletion in\n  codon 11) because this is the only option that produces a frameshift mutation\n  at codon 11.

Acetyl-CoA is not being recycled through the\ncitric acid cycle because the citric acid cycle intermediates (mainly\noxaloacetate) have been depleted to feed the gluconeogenesis pathway, and the\nresulting accumulation of acetyl-CoA activates ketogenesis.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Ketone\nbodies are created at moderate levels in everyone&rsquo;s bodies, such as during\nsleep and other times when no carbohydrates are available. However, when\nketogenesis happens at higher-than-normal levels, the body is said to be in a\nstate of ketosis. Both acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate are acidic, and, if\nlevels of these ketones are too high, the pH of the blood drops, resulting in\nketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis occurs in individuals with untreated type I diabetes\nmellitus (diabetic ketoacidosis) and in alcoholics after prolonged\nbinge-drinking without sufficient intake of carbohydrates (alcoholic\nketoacidosis). Ketoacidosis produces an increased-anion-gap metabolic acidosis.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n <span>\n  Ketogenesis\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n <span>\n  <img alt=\"Description: ketogenesis_pathway\" border=\"0\" height=\"328\" src=\"_%20Tutorials_files/image130.png\" v:shapes=\"Picture_x0020_347143\" width=\"303\"/>\n </span>\n <span>\n </span>\n</p>\n", "choices": ["A.

These transmembrane\nreceptors contain a central pore, or ion channel, which opens in response to\nthe binding of a ligand. The channel is usually selective to one or more ions\n(e.g., Na\n <sup>\n  +\n </sup>\n , K\n <sup>\n  +\n </sup>\n , Ca\n <sup>\n  2+\n </sup>\n , or Cl\n <sup>\n  -\n </sup>\n ). Ion\nchannels are especially important at certain neuronal synapses, where they\nconvert chemical signals from neurotransmitters to electrical signals in the\npostsynaptic neuron. The prototype of a ligand-gated ion channel is the\nnicotinic acetylcholine receptor. When acetylcholine binds to the receptor, the\nreceptor&rsquo;s configuration changes, allowing the pore to open. Na\n <sup>\n  +\n </sup>\n ions flow down an electrochemical gradient into the cell. When many channels\nopen at once, the intracellular Na\n <sup>\n  +\n </sup>\n concentration rises to a level\nat which the positive charge within the cell is enough to depolarize the\nmembrane, initiating an action potential.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  2.\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  </span>\n </span>\n G-protein-coupled receptors.\n <span>\n  &nbsp;\n </span>\n These transmembrane receptors do\n <i>\n  not\n </i>\n contain a central pore, or ion\nchannel. Instead, they are\n <i>\n  indirectly\n </i>\n linked with ion channels through G- proteins, which serve as signal\ntransducers. G-proteins may activate other enzymes, such as adenyl cyclase or\nphospholipase. Because several steps exist between receptor activation and ion\nchannel opening, these ion channels take longer to open than ligand-gated ion\nchannels &ndash; and they stay open longer than ligand-gated channels.\nG-protein-coupled receptors include receptors for norepinephrine, epinephrine,\ndopamine, serotonin, histamine, muscarinic acetylcholine, and GABA\n <sub>\n  B\n </sub>\n .\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  3.\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Enzyme-linked\nreceptors. These\n </span>\n transmembrane receptors have enzymatic activity on the\nintracellular side, triggered by ligand binding on the extracellular side. Most\nenzyme-linked receptors are tyrosine kinases, which phosphorylate tyrosine\nresidues.

Steroid hormones and thyroid hormones bind to\nnuclear receptors. There are two major types of nuclear receptors. Class I\nreceptors are located in the cytosol. When activated by ligand, they\ntranslocate to the nucleus, bind to a specific DNA sequence, and enhance DNA\ntranscription. Class II receptors are located in the nucleus (regardless of\nligand-binding status).

The main types of transplant rejection are\nhyperacute, acute, and chronic.\n   </span>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <span>\n   </span>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <i>\n    Hyperacute rejection\n   </i>\n   usually occurs within 24 hours of\ntransplantation. The response is so quick that the graft never becomes\nvascularized. Hyperacute rejection is characterized by thrombotic occlusions\nand hemorrhages of the graft vasculature that begin minutes to hours after the\ngraft is placed. These occur because of preexisting host antibodies that bind\nto antigens present in the graft endothelium. The complement system is\nactivated and there is an influx of neutrophils. Endothelial cells and\nplatelets shed lipid particles, which promote coagulation. The resulting\ninflammation prevents vascularization of the graft. The graft suffers\nirreversible damage from ischemia.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   There are several\nexplanations for the preexisting antibodies that initiate hyperacute rejection.\nRecipients of blood transfusions sometimes develop antibodies to major\nhistocompatibility class (MHC) antigens from the transfused blood. If some of\nthese antigens match those in a graft, then hyperacute rejection may occur.\nMultiple pregnancies may also expose woman to the paternal antigens of the\nfetus, resulting in the creation of antibodies. Finally, prior recipients of\ntransplants may have already formed antibodies to other MHC antigens &ndash;\nantibodies that may be present at the time of a second transplant. Usually\nhyperacute rejection can be avoided by screening for anti-graft antibodies\n(crossmatching).\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <i>\n    <span>\n     Acute rejection\n    </span>\n   </i>\n   <span>\n    usually begins a week\nafter transplantation and most likely occurs to some degree in all transplants\n(except between identical twins). It is caused by mismatched HLA antigens that\nare present on all cells. HLA antigens are polymorphic; therefore, the chance\nof a perfect match is extremely rare. The reason that acute rejection occurs a\nweek after transplantation is because the T cells involved in rejection must\ndifferentiate and the antibodies must be produced before rejection is\ninitiated. Some T cells cause graft cells to lyse; others produce cytokines\nthat recruit other inflammatory cells, eventually causing necrosis of allograft\ntissue. Endothelial cells in vascularized grafts such as kidneys are some of\nthe earliest victims of acute rejection. Damage to the endothelial lining is an\nearly predictor of irreversible acute graft failure. The risk of acute\nrejection is highest in the first three months after transplantation and is\nlowered by immunosuppressive agents. The diagnosis of acute rejection is based\non clinical data, laboratory testing, and tissue biopsy.\n   </span>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <span>\n   </span>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <i>\n    <span>\n     Chronic rejection\n    </span>\n   </i>\n   <span>\n    occurs months to years\nfollowing transplantation. It is characterized by graft arterial occlusions,\nwhich result from the proliferation of smooth muscle cells and the production\nof collagen by fibroblasts. This process, termed accelerated or graft\narteriosclerosis, results in fibrosis, which can cause ischemia and cell death.\nThe fibrous lesions occur without evidence of an overt cause (such as vascular\ninjury or infection), although it is hypothesized that chronic rejection is the\nresult of multiple acute rejections. This hypothesis is based on the knowledge\nthat the resulting fibrosis is similar to the fibrosis that accompanies the\nnatural healing of a wound. Now that there are treatments for acute rejection,\nchronic rejection is the major cause of graft loss. Most recipients must take\nimmunosuppressive drugs for the rest of their lives, and even that may not be\nenough to combat chronic rejection. This poses a dilemma in the trend of\nimmunotherapy, since immunosuppression is highly focused to prevent acute\nrejection and does not substantially address chronic rejection mechanisms.\n   </span>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <span>\n   </span>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <i>\n    Graft-versus-host disease\n   </i>\n   (GVHD) is a common complication of\nallogeneic bone marrow\n   <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation\" title=\"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation\">\n   </a>\n   transplantation in which\nfunctional T cells in the transplanted marrow recognize the recipient as\n\"foreign\" and mount an immunologic attack.\n   <i>\n    Acute\n   </i>\n   graft-versus-host-disease occurs within the first 100 days\nand is characterized by selective damage to the gastrointestinal tract, liver,\nand skin.

Most tumor markers are made by normal cells as well as by cancer cells;\nhowever, they are produced at much higher levels in cancerous conditions. These\nsubstances can be found in the blood, urine, stool, tumor tissue, or other\ntissues or bodily fluids of some patients with cancer. Most tumor markers are\nproteins. However, more recently, patterns of gene expression and changes to\nDNA have also begun to be used as tumor markers. Markers of the latter type are\nassessed in tumor tissue specifically.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Thus far, more than 20\ndifferent tumor markers have been characterized and are in clinical use. Some\nare associated with only one type of cancer, whereas others are associated with\ntwo or more cancer types. There is no &ldquo;universal&rdquo; tumor marker that can detect\nany type of cancer.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   There are some limitations\nto the use of tumor markers. Sometimes, noncancerous conditions can cause the\nlevels of certain tumor markers to increase.

It causes a\nchronic low-level inflammation of the stomach lining and is strongly linked to\nthe development of duodenal and gastric ulcers and stomach cancer. Over 80% of\nindividuals infected with the bacterium are asymptomatic. The bacterium\nproduces urease, which converts urea to ammonia and carbon dioxide. Four tests\nare available for detecting\n  <i>\n   H. pylori\n  </i>\n  <span>\n   : blood antibody test, urea breath test, stool antigen test, and\nstomach biopsy. During the urea breath test, p\n  </span>\n  atients swallow urea\nlabelled with an uncommon isotope, either radioactive carbon-14 or\nnon-radioactive carbon-13. In the subsequent 10&ndash;30 minutes, the detection\nof isotope-labelled carbon dioxide in exhaled breath indicates that the urea\nwas split; this indicates that urease is present in the stomach, and hence that\n  <i>\n   H. pylori\n  </i>\n  bacteria are present. The\n  <span>\n   Rapid urease test\n  </span>\n  , also known as the CLO test (Campylobacter-like\norganism test), is a rapid test for diagnosis of\n  <i>\n   Helicobacter pylori\n  </i>\n  .\nThe test is performed at the time of gastroscopy. A biopsy of mucosa is taken\nfrom the antrum of the stomach, and is placed into a medium containing urea and\nan indicator such as phenol red. The urease produced by\n  <i>\n   H. pylori\n  </i>\n  hydrolyzes urea to ammonia, which raises the pH of the medium, and changes the\ncolor of the specimen from yellow (negative) to red (positive).\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  <span>\n   L.\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  11.\n  <i>\n   Clostridium difficile\n  </i>\n  <span>\n   is the\nmost common infectious cause of antibiotic-associated colitis.\n  </span>\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  <span>\n   M.\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  13.\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;\n  </span>\n  Respiratory syncytial virus (\n </span>\n <span>\n  RSV) is the most common\ncause of bronchiolitis (and pneumonia) in children under 1 year of age.\nSymptoms include coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath.

The main symptoms are profuse watery diarrhea\nand vomiting. The diarrhea is frequently described as \"rice water.\"\nAn untreated person may produce 10-20 liters of stool a day. Disease\ntransmission is primarily through consumption of contaminated water or food.\nThe severity of the diarrhea and vomiting can lead to rapid dehydration and\nelectrolyte imbalance. Primary treatment is rehydration. Cholera affects 3-5\nmillion people worldwide and causes more than 100,000 deaths each year.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <i>\n  <span>\n   Escherichia coli\n  </span>\n </i>\n <span>\n  O157:H7\n </span>\n is an enterohemorrhagic strain of the bacterium\n <i>\n  Escherichia\ncoli\n </i>\n <span>\n  .\n </span>\n Infection often leads\nto hemorrhagic diarrhea and, occasionally, to renal failure, especially in\nyoung children and the elderly. Transmission is via the fecal-oral route.\n <i>\n  E.\ncoli\n </i>\n is a Gram-negative bacillus, of which there are hundreds of serotypes.\nMost are harmless. Serotype O157:H7, however, can produce Shiga-like toxins,\nwhich cause severe illness. In some individuals (particularly children under\nfive years of age and the elderly), infection can lead to hemolytic uremic\nsyndrome (HUS), a condition characterized by hemolytic anemia,\nthrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure. In HUS, bacterial toxins stimulate\nplatelet activation and the formation of microthrombi in arterioles and\ncapillaries. Platelets are consumed and red blood cells are damaged as they\nsqueeze through the narrowed blood vessels. This process is called\n\"microangiopathic hemolysis.\" Schistocytes, or fragments of sheared\nred blood cells, appear in the blood and are a key finding in the diagnosis of\nHUS.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Pertussis\n </span>\n , also known as\n <span>\n  whooping\ncough,\n </span>\n is a highly contagious disease caused by the bacterium\n <i>\n  Bordetella\npertussis\n </i>\n . The condition lasts about six weeks and is named after the\n\"whoop\" sound made from the inspiration of air after a cough. (The\nhigh-pitched &ldquo;whoop&rdquo; occurs mainly in infants and children.) The classic\nsymptoms are paroxysmal cough, inspiratory whoop, and post-tussive vomiting\n(after-cough vomiting). The cough is violent and has been associated with\nsubconjunctival hemorrhage, rib fracture, and syncope. Patients present with\nmild respiratory symptoms, such as sneezing, runny nose, and cough (catarrhal\nstage). After one to two weeks, the cough develops into uncontrollable fits,\neach followed by a high-pitched \"whoop\" (in younger children) or a\ngasp (in older children). This is the paroxysmal stage. The &ldquo;whoop&rdquo; or gasp\noccurs as the patient struggles to inhale. Between coughing fits, the patient\noften appears well. The pertussis vaccine, an acellular vaccine, saves many\nlives each year.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Gas gangrene\n </span>\n (also known as \"Clostridial myonecrosis\" or\n\"myonecrosis\") is a deadly form of gangrene usually caused by\n <i>\n  Clostridium\nperfringens.\n </i>\n The condition usually occurs at the site of trauma or a recent\nsurgical wound. The onset of illness is sudden and dramatic. Predisposing\nconditions include peripheral arterial disease and diabetes. Clostridia produce\nmany different toxins that can cause potentially deadly syndromes. The site of\ninfection becomes inflamed, swollen, and very tender. Palpation of the region\nelicits crackling because of subcutaneous gas. Vesicles appear which merge into\nlarge blisters. A serosanguinous discharge is common. The edge of the infected\narea may expand over minutes. High fever, tachycardia, sweating, and exquisite\npain are typical.\n <span>\n  &nbsp;\n </span>\n If the condition\nis not treated, shock ensues and death soon follows.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Toxic shock syndrome usually\nresults from infection with\n <i>\n  Staphylococcus aureus\n </i>\n <span>\n  . Patients present with\n </span>\n high fever, low blood pressure, and\nconfusion, which may progress rapidly to stupor, coma, and multi-organ failure.\nThe characteristic rash, often seen early in the course of illness, resembles\nsunburn, and can involve any region of the body, including the lips, mouth,\neyes, palms and soles. D\n <span>\n  esquamation\noccurs\n </span>\n after 10&ndash;14 days. Toxic shock syndrome is caused by a\nsuperantigen toxin, which is produced by\n <i>\n  Staphylococcus aureus\n </i>\n <span>\n  . The superantigen is called toxic shock\nsyndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1).\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Scarlet fever\n </span>\n is caused by an exotoxin (&ldquo;erythrogenic toxin&rdquo;)\nproduced by\n <i>\n  Streptococcus pyogenes\n </i>\n . The disease is characterized by high\nfever, sore throat, tonsillar exudate, cervical lymphadenopathy, bright red\ntongue (&ldquo;strawberry tongue&rdquo;), and characteristic rash. The rash is fine, red,\nand rough-textured. It usually appears on the neck and face, often leaving a\nclear unaffected area around the mouth. It then spreads to the chest, back, and\nextremities. Classic red streaks that run together (Pastia lines) appear in body\ncreases, especially the axillae, elbows, and groin. The rash blanches with\npressure and fades by the sixth day. The affected skin desquamates. Blood tests\nshow marked leukocytosis and an elevated antistreptolysin O titer. Streptococci\nmay be cultured from the throat. Two types of complications are possible:\n&ldquo;septic&rdquo; and &ldquo;immune.&rdquo; Septic complications result from bacteremia, and include\nsinusitis, pneumonia, and meningitis. Immune complications include acute\nglomerulonephritis, rheumatic fever and erythema nodosum.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Botulism\n </span>\n is a paralytic illness caused by botulinum toxin, which\nis produced by the bacterium\n <i>\n  Clostridium botulinum\n </i>\n <span>\n  . The toxin prevents the release of\nacetylcholine at motor nerve endings in the parasympathetic system. It\n </span>\n enters the body in one of three ways: by colonization of the digestive tract by\nthe bacterium, by ingestion of toxin from foods, or by bacterial wound\ncontamination.\n <span>\n  &nbsp;\n </span>\n All forms lead to\nparalysis, which typically starts with the muscles of the face and spreads to\nthe limbs. Initial manifestations include blurred vision, ptosis, loss of\nfacial expression, swallowing problems, and difficulty speaking. Severe\nbotulism can lead to respiratory failure. The autonomic nervous system may be\nimpaired, causing dry mouth, postural hypotension, and constipation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Tetanus\n </span>\n is characterized by prolonged contraction of skeletal\nmuscle. The condition is caused by a neurotoxin produced by the Gram-positive,\nanaerobic bacterium\n <i>\n  Clostridium tetani\n </i>\n . The toxin acts by binding\ninhibitory neurons, blocking the release of neurotransmitters. Infection\ngenerally occurs through wound contamination.\n <span>\n  Generalized tetanus\n </span>\n occurs in 80% of cases and follows a\ndescending pattern. The first sign is trismus (&ldquo;lockjaw&rdquo;) and facial spasm,\nfollowed by stiffness of the neck, difficulty swallowing, and rigidity of\npectoral and calf muscles. Other findings include elevated temperature,\nelevated blood pressure, rapid heart rate, and sweating. The tetanus vaccine,\ncomposed of tetanus toxoid, is very effective at preventing disease.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome\n </span>\n is induced by epidermolytic\nexotoxins A and B, which are released by\n <i>\n  Staphylococcus aureus\n </i>\n and cause\ndetachment within the epidermal layer. The exotoxins are proteases that cleave\ndesmoglein-1, which holds the granulosum and spinosum layers of the epidermis\ntogether. The disease most commonly affects neonates and usually begins with\nfever, irritability, and a faint rash. Within 1-2 days, the rash progresses to\na blistering eruption. Tissue paper-like wrinkling of the epidermis occurs and\nlarge bullae appear. As sheets of epidermis are shed, a moist erythematous base\nis revealed. Although the clinical picture is dramatic, the process usually\nends with desquamation, and healing is complete in 5-7 days.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Staphylococcal food\npoisoning is caused by enterotoxins produced by\n <em>\n  Staphylococcus aureus\n </em>\n <em>\n  <span>\n   . The bacteria multiply in\nfood, where they produce heat-resistant enterotoxins (toxins that cannot be\ndestroyed by cooking). When ingested, the\n  </span>\n </em>\n toxins are fast-acting,\nsometimes causing illness in as little as thirty minutes. On average, symptoms\noccur one to six hours after eating, and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal\npain, and diarrhea. The illness is usually brief, and most patients recover in\none to three days.\n <span>\n  Foods associated with staph food\npoisoning include meats; poultry and egg products; salads such as egg, tuna,\nchicken, potato, and macaroni; bakery products such as cream-filled pastries,\ncream pies, and chocolate &eacute;clairs; sandwich fillings; and milk and dairy\nproducts.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Anthrax\n </span>\n is a disease caused by the bacterium\n <i>\n  Bacillus anthracis\n </i>\n .\nThe bacterium enters the body through the lungs, intestines, or skin. Symptoms\ndepend on site of entry. Lung infection causes flu-like symptoms, followed by\nrespiratory collapse. Intestinal infection causes abdominal pain, hematemesis,\nand diarrhea. Cutaneous infection results in a boil-like lesion that forms a\nlarge, painless, necrotic ulcer.

The inflammatory\nresponse that accompanies infection is usually marked by fever.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Fever is\nan elevation in body temperature above the normal range in response to a\ncentral nervous system change in the set point. Normal oral temperature ranges\nfrom 36.0 to 37.7&deg; C, with a circadian variation of 1&deg; C or more between the\nmorning nadir and the evening peak. Mean oral temperature in healthy adults is\n36.8 &plusmn; 0.4&deg; C, with women exhibiting slightly higher values than men. Rectal\ntemperatures are 0.4&deg; C higher than oral and 0.8&deg; C higher than aural (tympanic\nmembrane) temperatures. Clinicians generally define significant fever as a\ntemperature higher than 38.3&deg; C (101.0&deg; F).\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  The vast\nmajority of acute febrile illnesses lasting less than two weeks have an\ninfectious cause. These infections occur predominantly where body surfaces\ninteract with the environment, such as the upper and lower respiratory tracts,\ngastrointestinal and genitourinary systems, and skin. The majority of acute\nrespiratory and gastrointestinal infections are viral in nature. As the duration\nof the febrile illness lengthens beyond three weeks, other inflammatory\nillnesses become more prominent in the differential diagnosis. Most chronic\nfebrile illnesses are not caused by infection.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <a name=\"4-u1.0-B978-1-4377-1604-7..00288-8--s001\">\n </a>\n <a name=\"4-u1.0-B978-1-4377-1604-7..00288-8--st00\">\n </a>\n <span>\n  Infection ensues when a pathogen overcomes both\nnonspecific innate and specific adaptive humoral and cellular immune responses.\nThe normal indigenous microflora, host physical barriers (e.g., skin, mucous\nmembranes, cilia), and soluble factors (e.g., cytokines, complement) provide\nimportant barricades to pathogen invasion. Disruption of these barriers, which\nprovide a first line of defense, permits the invasion of pathogens.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  The acute\nphase response triggered by such disruption provides direct antimicrobial\nactivity and prompts the development of adaptive immunity mediated by\nlymphocytes and macrophages. This inflammatory response plays an important role\nin containing infection. Unfortunately, an exaggerated response may worsen the\nclinical condition.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Body\ntemperature is regulated both physiologically and behaviorally. Basal metabolic\nprocesses, governed especially by thyroid hormones but also by catecholamines\nand growth hormone, are responsible for the normal resting body temperature.\nThermogenesis may be increased up to 80% by hyperthyroidism and decreased as\nmuch as 50% by hypothyroidism. Moderate activity increases thermogenesis and\nresults in a transiently increased temperature until heat-dissipating processes\nare engaged.\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;\n  </span>\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  The\nhypothalamus contains temperature-sensitive neurons that have receptors for\npro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, which are continuously\nbalanced to maintain a homeothermic set point. When body temperature becomes\nelevated, cutaneous vasodilation and sweating occur, and people may reduce\nactivity and seek a cooler environment. In contrast, low body temperature is\nincreased by shivering, piloerection, cutaneous vasoconstriction, adding\nclothes, and seeking a warmer environment.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  In febrile\nillness, symptoms are often due to the fever itself. Malaise is the rule, and many\nfebrile patients experience myalgia secondary to muscle contractions used to\nraise temperature. The chill associated with rigors may be related to surface\nvasoconstriction that accompanies the increase in core temperature. The body&rsquo;s\nthermoregulatory mechanisms rarely allow fevers to exceed 41&deg; C (106&deg; F).\nTemperatures exceeding 41&deg; C are often due to a drug-induced imbalance in these\nmechanisms and may cause direct cellular damage.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Fever is a\ncomplex physiologic process involving metabolic and immunologic responses.\nBacteria release cell wall products such as peptidoglycans and endotoxin, as\nwell as enterotoxins, which bind to Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on phagocytes\n(neutrophils, macrophages) and endothelial cells. As a result, pyrogenic\ncytokines such as interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor\n(TNF)-&alpha; are released into the circulation and bind to cytokine receptors\nin the hypothalamus. This stimulates the brain to produce prostaglandin E\n  <sub>\n   2\n  </sub>\n  (PGE\n  <sub>\n   2\n  </sub>\n  ) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which trigger\nneurons in the thermoregulatory center to raise the hypothalamic thermostatic\nset point. In addition, neuronal signals to the cortex prompt behavioral\nchanges to conserve heat (e.g., shivering, adding clothing). The hypothalamus\nalso triggers sympathetic peripheral efferent nerves that constrict peripheral\nblood vessels and conserve central heat.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Leukocytosis\noften occurs in response to infection. Neutrophilia is the norm in most acute\ninfections, whatever the cause. Neutropenia may be seen in rickettsial, severe\nviral and overwhelming bacterial infections. Eosinophilia is typical of\ninvasive helminthic and some protozoal infections. Lymphocytosis may accompany\nmany viral and rickettsial infections and is common during convalescence from\nacute bacterial infection. Monocytosis may be seen in tuberculosis. Virtually\nall infections have an impact on the erythroid system, but given the long\nhalf-life of erythrocytes, usually only chronic infections or other\ninflammatory diseases result in anemia. Few acute infections produce anemia.\n </span>\n</p>\n", "choices": ["A. Staphylococcus aureus", "B. Streptococcus pyogenes", "C. Corynebacterium diphtheriae", "D. Vibrio cholerae", "E.

These\nantigens may be\n <i>\n  self\n </i>\n or\n <i>\n  nonself\n </i>\n . (The protein fragment is\nsometimes compared to a hot dog, and the MHC protein to the bun.) The\npresentation of MHC/peptide on cell surfaces allows for pathogen surveillance\nby immune cells, usually T cells or natural killer (NK) cells. If T cells or NK\ncells recognize an MHC/peptide combination, the cells become activated and\nlaunch an immune response against the presented antigen.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Because MHC genes must\ndefend against a great variety of microbes in the environment, the MHC\nmolecules (coded for by the MHC genes) must be able to present a wide range of\npeptides. MHC genes achieve this through several mechanisms: (1) the MHC locus\nis polygenic, (2) MHC genes are highly polymorphic and numerous alleles exist,\nand (3) several MHC genes are codominantly expressed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n There are two general\nclasses of MHC molecules: Class I and Class II. Class I MHC molecules are found\non all nucleated cells and present peptides to cytotoxic T cells. Class II MHC\nmolecules are found on certain immune cells, chiefly macrophages, B cells and\ndendritic cells, collectively known as professional antigen-presenting cells\n(APCs). These APCs specialize in the uptake of pathogens and subsequent\nprocessing into peptide fragments within phagosomes. The Class II MHC molecules\non APCs present these fragments to helper T cells, which stimulate an immune\nreaction from other cells.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  There are\ntwo classical pathways by which proteins can be processed and displayed.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  <span>\n   1.\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Phagocytic cells such as\nmacrophages and immature dendritic cells engulf pathogens in a process known as\nphagocytosis. Pathogen-containing endosomes then fuse with lysosomes and\nmediate their destruction. Degraded particles are then loaded onto MHC Class II\nmolecules and trafficked to the cell surface.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  <span>\n   2.\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  All nucleated cells can\nalso present cytosolic peptides on their class I MHC. This pathway is\nparticularly important during infection by a bacterium or virus, or if the cell\nis cancerous. In a normal cell, class I MHC continually present self-peptides\nderived from basal protein turnover and defective ribosomal products. However,\nduring a viral infection or tumor development, peptides loaded onto class I MHC\nwill include those of processed pathogens degraded in the proteasome.\n </span>\n</p>\n", "choices": ["A.

The inflammation\nis usually caused by microbial infection and less commonly by certain drugs.\nMeningitis can be life-threatening because of the inflammation&rsquo;s proximity to\nthe brain and spinal cord; therefore the condition is classified as a medical\nemergency.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The most common symptoms of\nmeningitis are headache and neck stiffness associated with fever, confusion or\naltered consciousness, vomiting, and an inability to tolerate light\n(photophobia) or loud noises (phonophobia). Sometimes, especially in small\nchildren, only nonspecific symptoms may be present, such as irritability and\ndrowsiness. If a rash is present, it may indicate a particular cause of\nmeningitis; for instance, meningitis caused by meningococcal bacteria may be\naccompanied by a characteristic rash.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n A lumbar puncture may be\nused to diagnose or exclude meningitis. This involves inserting a needle into\nthe spinal canal to extract a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the fluid\nthat envelops the brain and spinal cord. The CSF is then examined in a medical\nlaboratory. The usual treatment for meningitis is the prompt application of\nantibiotics (for bacterial meningitis).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Meningitis can lead to\nserious long-term consequences such as deafness, epilepsy, hydrocephalus and\ncognitive deficits, especially if not treated quickly. Some forms of meningitis\n(such as those associated with meningococci,\n <i>\n  Haemophilus influenzae\n </i>\n type\nB, pneumococci or mumps virus infections) may be prevented by immunization.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  In adults,\na severe headache is the most common symptom of meningitis &ndash; occurring in\nalmost 90% of cases of bacterial meningitis, followed by nuchal rigidity\n(inability to flex the neck forward passively due to increased neck muscle tone\nand stiffness).

Other signs of\nmeningism include the presence of positive Kernig sign or Brudzinski sign.\nKernig sign is assessed with the patient lying supine, with the hip and knee flexed\nto 90 degrees. In a patient with a positive Kernig sign, pain limits passive\nextension of the knee. A positive Brudzinski's sign occurs when flexion of the\nneck causes involuntary flexion of the knee and hip. Although Kernig and\nBrudzinski signs are both commonly used to screen for meningitis, the\nsensitivity of these tests is limited. They do, however, have very good\nspecificity for meningitis: the signs rarely occur in other diseases.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Meningitis\ncaused by the bacterium\n  <i>\n   Neisseria meningitidis\n  </i>\n  (known as &ldquo;meningococcal\nmeningitis&rdquo;) can be differentiated from meningitis with other causes by a\nrapidly spreading petechial rash which may precede other symptoms. The rash\nconsists of numerous small, irregular purple or red spots (&ldquo;petechiae&rdquo;) on the\ntrunk, lower extremities, mucous membranes, conjuctiva, and (occasionally) the\npalms of the hands or soles of the feet. The rash is typically non-blanching:\nthe redness does not disappear when pressed with a finger or a glass tumbler.\nAlthough this rash is not necessarily present in meningococcal meningitis, it\nis relatively specific for the disease.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The types of bacteria that\ncause bacterial meningitis vary by age group. In premature babies and newborns\nup to three months old, common causes are\n <i>\n  group B streptococci\n </i>\n (which\nnormally inhabit the vagina and are mainly a cause during the first week of\nlife) and those that normally inhabit the digestive tract such as\n <i>\n  Escherichia\ncoli\n </i>\n (carrying K1 antigen).\n <i>\n  Listeria monocytogenes\n </i>\n may affect the\nnewborn and occurs in epidemics. Older children are more commonly affected by\n <i>\n  Neisseria\nmeningitidis\n </i>\n (meningococcus),\n <i>\n  Streptococcus pneumoniae\n </i>\n (serotypes 6,\n9, 14, 18 and 23) and those under five by\n <i>\n  Haemophilus influenzae\n </i>\n type B\n(mainly in countries that do not offer vaccination). In adults,\n <i>\n  N.\nmeningitidis\n </i>\n and\n <i>\n  S. pneumoniae\n </i>\n together cause 80% of all cases of\nbacterial meningitis, with increased risk of\n <i>\n  L. monocytogenes\n </i>\n in those\nover 50 years old. Since the pneumococcal vaccine was introduced, however,\nrates of pneumococcal meningitis have declined in children and adults.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Recent trauma to the skull\ngives bacteria in the nasal cavity the potential to enter the meningeal space.\nSimilarly, individuals with a cerebral shunt or related device are at increased\nrisk of infection through those devices. In these cases, infections with\nstaphylococci are more likely, as well as infections by pseudomonas and other\nGram-negative bacilli. The same pathogens are also more common in those with an\nimpaired immune system. In some people, an infection in the head and neck area,\nsuch as otitis media or mastoiditis, can lead to meningitis. Tuberculous\nmeningitis, meningitis due to infection with\n <i>\n  Mycobacterium tuberculosis\n </i>\n ,\nis more common in those from countries where tuberculosis is common, but is\nalso encountered in those with immune problems, such as AIDS.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n A literature review of 363\nreported cases of\n <i>\n  recurrent\n </i>\n meningitis showed that 59% of cases are due to anatomical abnormalities, 36%\ndue to immune deficiencies (such as complement deficiency, which predisposes\nespecially to recurrent meningococcal meningitis), and 5% due to ongoing\ninfections in areas adjacent to the meninges.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The term\n <i>\n  aseptic\nmeningitis\n </i>\n refers loosely to all cases of meningitis in which no bacterial\ninfection can be demonstrated. This is usually due to viruses, but it may be\ndue to bacterial infection that has already been partially treated, with\ndisappearance of the bacteria from the meninges, or by infection in a space\nadjacent to the meninges (e.g. sinusitis). Endocarditis (infection of the heart\nvalves with spread of small clusters of bacteria through the bloodstream) may\ncause aseptic meningitis. Aseptic meningitis may also result from infection\nwith spirochetes, a type of bacteria that includes\n <i>\n  Treponema pallidum\n </i>\n (the cause of syphilis) and\n <i>\n  Borrelia burgdorferi\n </i>\n (known for causing Lyme\ndisease). Meningitis may be encountered in cerebral malaria (malaria infecting\nthe brain). Fungal meningitis, e.g. due to\n <i>\n  Cryptococcus neoformans\n </i>\n , is\ntypically seen in people with immune deficiency such as AIDS.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Meningitis may occur as the\nresult of several non-infectious causes: spread of cancer to the meninges (\n <i>\n  malignant\nmeningitis\n </i>\n ) and certain drugs (mainly non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\nand antibiotics). It may also be caused by several inflammatory conditions such\nas sarcoidosis (which is then called neurosarcoidosis), connective tissue\ndisorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus, and certain forms of vasculitis\nsuch as Beh&ccedil;et's disease.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The most important test in\nidentifying or ruling out meningitis is analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid\nthrough lumbar puncture (LP, spinal tap). However, lumbar puncture is\ncontraindicated if there is a mass in the brain or the intracranial pressure\n(ICP) is elevated, as it may lead to brain herniation. If someone is at risk\nfor either a mass or raised ICP (recent head injury, a known immune system\nproblem, localizing neurological signs, or evidence on examination of a raised\nICP), a CT or MRI scan is recommended prior to the lumbar puncture. If a CT or\nMRI is required before LP, or if LP proves difficult, professional guidelines\nsuggest that antibiotics should be administered first to prevent delay in\ntreatment, especially if this may be longer than 30&nbsp;minutes.\n</p>\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n <table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n  <tr>\n   <td colspan=\"4\" width=\"390\">\n    <p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n     <span>\n     </span>\n    </p>\n    <p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n     <b>\n      <span>\n       CSF Findings in\n  Meningitis\n      </span>\n     </b>\n    </p>\n    <p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n     <span>\n     </span>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td colspan=\"4\" width=\"390\">\n    <p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n     <span>\n     </span>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>\n    <p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n     <b>\n      <span>\n       Type of\n      </span>\n     </b>\n    </p>\n    <p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n     <b>\n      <span>\n       meningitis\n      </span>\n     </b>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n   <td>\n    <p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n     <b>\n      <span>\n       Glucose\n      </span>\n     </b>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n   <td>\n    <p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n     <b>\n      <span>\n       Protein\n      </span>\n     </b>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n   <td width=\"170\">\n    <p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n     <b>\n      <span>\n       Cells\n      </span>\n     </b>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>\n    <p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n     <b>\n      <span>\n      </span>\n     </b>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n   <td>\n    <p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n     <b>\n      <span>\n      </span>\n     </b>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n   <td>\n    <p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n     <b>\n      <span>\n      </span>\n     </b>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n   <td width=\"170\">\n    <p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n     <b>\n      <span>\n      </span>\n     </b>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>\n    <p>\n     <b>\n      <span>\n       Acute\n  bacterial\n      </span>\n     </b>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n   <td>\n    <p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n     <span>\n      low\n     </span>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n   <td>\n    <p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n     <span>\n      high\n     </span>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n   <td width=\"170\">\n    <p>\n     <span>\n      Neutrophils\n  predominate;\n     </span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     <span>\n      WBCs\n  &gt; 500/mm&sup3;\n     </span>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>\n    <p>\n     <b>\n      <span>\n       Acute\n  viral\n      </span>\n     </b>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n   <td>\n    <p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n     <span>\n      normal\n     </span>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n   <td>\n    <p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n     <span>\n      normal or high\n     </span>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n   <td width=\"170\">\n    <p>\n     <span>\n      Lymphocytes\n  predominate;\n     </span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     <span>\n      WBCs\n  &lt; 100/mm&sup3;\n     </span>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>\n    <p>\n     <b>\n      <span>\n       Tuberculous\n      </span>\n     </b>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n   <td>\n    <p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n     <span>\n      low\n     </span>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n   <td>\n    <p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n     <span>\n      high\n     </span>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n   <td width=\"170\">\n    <p>\n     <span>\n      Lymphocytes\n  predominate;\n     </span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     <span>\n      WBC\n  count variable\n     </span>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>\n    <p>\n     <b>\n      <span>\n       Fungal\n      </span>\n     </b>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n   <td>\n    <p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n     <span>\n      low\n     </span>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n   <td>\n    <p style=\"text-align:center;\">\n     <span>\n      high\n     </span>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n   <td width=\"170\">\n    <p>\n     <span>\n      Lymphocytes\n  predominate;\n     </span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     <span>\n      WBC\n  count variable\n     </span>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n </table>\n</div>\n", "choices": ["A.

Morbilliviruses, like other paramyxoviruses, are enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses.  Classic symptoms of measles include four-day fevers and the three Cs \u2013 cough, coryza (runny nose) and conjunctivitis (red eyes). The fever may reach 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F). Koplik's spots inside the mouth are pathognomonic (diagnostic) for measles, but are not often seen because they are transient, disappearing within a day. The characteristic rash is a generalized erythematous maculopapular rash that begins several days after fever commences. The rash, often itchy, starts on the head and spreads to most of the body. It appears two to four days after initial symptoms, lasts for up to eight days, and changes color from red to brown before disappearing. \u00a0  Measles is spread through droplets from a person\u2019s nose or mouth, and is highly contagious \u2013 90% of those sharing a living space with an infected person will catch it. Complications are relatively common and include diarrhea, pneumonia, and acute encephalitis.  Rubella, commonly known as German measles, is a disease caused by the rubella virus, a member of the togaviridae family. The name \u201crubella\u201d is derived from the Latin word meaning little red. The disease is transmitted via airborne droplets from the upper respiratory tract and is usually mild, lasting 1-3 days. Children recover more quickly than adults. Infection of the mother during pregnancy can be serious; if the mother is infected within the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, the child may be born with congenital rubella syndrome (CRS).\u00a0   The primary finding is rash on the face that spreads to the trunk and limbs, and usually fades after three days (hence, the term \u201cthree-day measles\u201d). Other symptoms include fever, lymphadenopathy, joint pains, headache, and conjunctivitis. The fever rarely rises above 38 oC (100.4 oF), and the rash (usually itchy) is pink or light red. It disappears with no staining or peeling of the skin.   Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) is a double-stranded DNA virus and belongs to the Alpha Herpesvirus family.\u00a0 Herpesviruses can establish latent infection and persist indefinitely in the host.\u00a0 HSV-1is acquired via close contact to the virus from mucosal or genital and oral secretions.\u00a0 Primary HSV infection results in orolabial herpes or gingovostomatitis and recurrent infections manifest as cold sores and fever blisters.\u00a0 HSV-1 infection in neonates or immunocompromised hosts can be very severe.\u00a0 Symptoms associated with orolabial herpes include fever, chills, mayalgias, cervical lymphadenopathy, and irritability.  Erythrovirus B19 causes \u201cslapped cheek syndrome\u201d or Fifth\u2019s disease.\u00a0 This single-stranded DNA virus belongs to the parvoviridae family and can be spread by aerosal, fomites or transplacental transmission.\u00a0 Most cases are subclinical and occur in late winter to early spring.\u00a0 After a 7-10 day incubation, most patients present with low-grade fever, headache, and mild respiratory symptoms.\u00a0 A slapped-cheek rash appears 7 days later.\u00a0 The rash spreads and red blotches extend down to the trunk, arms, and legs.\u00a0 The rash, which has a lacy net-like appearance, usually spares the palms and soles.\u00a0 Serious complications include still births if the mother is infected during the second trimester and transient aplastic crises in sickle-cell patients.\u00a0 The virus lyses immature erythroid precursors.  Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is one of eight herpes viruses known to infect humans. It commonly causes chickenpox in children and zoster (shingles) in adults. Primary infection results in chickenpox (varicella), a highly contagious disease spread by coughing and sneezing and by direct contact with fluid from infected vesicles on the skin.\u00a0  Initial symptoms may include fever, malaise, headache, sore throat, myalgia, and itching. The chicken pox rash begins on the face and trunk and spreads to the extremities. Lesions start as 2-4 mm erythematous papules that develop an irregular outline (rose petal). A thin-walled, clear vesicle (dew drop) develops on top of the erythematous area. This \u201cdew drop on a rose petal\u201d is characteristic of chicken pox. After 8-12 hours, the fluid gets cloudy and the vesicle breaks, leaving a crust. The fluid is highly contagious, but once the lesions crust over, the patient is no longer infectious. The crust usually falls off after 7 days. Each lesion goes through this cycle in about 7 days, and new lesions crop up daily. Rare complications include pneumonia and encephalitis.   When clinical symptoms have resolved, VZV remains dormant in the nervous system, particularly in the trigeminal and dorsal root ganglia. In about 10\u201320% of cases, the virus reactivates later in life causing shingles. Shingles usually presents with pain and vesicular rash in a dermatomal distribution. Complications include postherpetic neuralgia (severe pain in the distribution of the affected nerve).\u00a0 The rash described in the vignette is typical of chickenpox, which is caused by the varicella-zoster virus.                          Answer E is correct. The rash described in the vignette is typical of chickenpox, which is caused by the varicella-zoster virus.                                            HIV-1 is sensitive to solvents such as chloroform and 20% diethyl ether, whereas hepatitis A virus is resistant to such solvents. This resistance is best explained by the absence of which of the following in hepatitis A virus?  A.\u00a0\u00a0 Single-stranded RNA B.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Reverse transcriptase C.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Spherical structure D.\u00a0\u00a0 Icosahedral symmetry E.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Viral envelope                                     Many viruses have an envelope surrounding the protein capsid. The envelope is usually derived from portions of the host cell membrane (which is comprised of phospholipids and proteins), but also includes virally derived glycoproteins. Functionally, the envelope is used by viruses to enter the host cell. Glycoproteins on the surface of the envelope bind to receptor sites on the host\u2019s membrane. The viral envelope then fuses with the host\u2019s membrane, allowing the capsid and viral genome to enter the host.  The viral envelope, which is composed of a lipid bilayer, is relatively sensitive to desiccation, heat, and detergents. Consequently, enveloped viruses are easier to sterilize than non-enveloped viruses. They have limited survival outside the host and typically must transfer directly from host to host.

The envelope is relatively sensitive to detergents and is needed to aid in attachment of the virus to the host cell. Loss of the envelope results in loss of infectivity. Enveloped viruses are easily inactivated by routine surface cleaning and disinfection. HIV-1 has an envelope; hepatitis A virus does not. This explains why HIV is more sensitive to detergents than hepatitis A.\u00a0                                            Heart & Lung           Chest Pain  A.\u00a0\u00a0 Costochondritis B.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Esophageal rupture C.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Gastroesophageal reflux D.\u00a0\u00a0 Myocardial infarction E.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pericarditis F.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pleuritis G.\u00a0\u00a0 Pneumonia H.\u00a0\u00a0 Pneumothorax I.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pulmonary embolism J.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Stable angina K.\u00a0\u00a0 Thoracic aortic dissection L.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Varicella-zoster  1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 28-year-old man develops sudden-onset chest pain and shortness of breath while standing.

The pressure goes away with rest.\u00a0  10.\u00a0 62-year-old man with a 30-pack-year smoking history is brought to the emergency department with severe, crushing pain in the chest that radiates to the left arm and jaw. The pain is a deep, heavy pressure that won\u2019t go away. It has been present for more than an hour and is accompanied by shortness of breath, sweating, and nausea.  11.\u00a0 70-year-old man presents with sharp pain and a vesicular rash over the right chest. The pain and rash have a band-like distribution. 12.\u00a0 72-year-old man visits his physician because of chest \u201cburning\u201d that is worse after meals, especially when he is supine. The evaluation of chest pain begins with a complete medical interview. The history may reveal nuances in the quality, location, duration, provoking events, and relieving measures, which serve to accurately focus the subsequent evaluation. However, with few exceptions, such as evident injury to the chest wall, a specific diagnosis cannot be made with complete confidence from the clinical history alone. Physical examination may reveal evidence of pleural, lung parenchymal, or airway disease; localized chest wall involvement; or signs of mitral valve prolapse, aortic valve stenosis, or other cardiac abnormalities.  For adults who present to the emergency department with new-onset chest pain, the immediate concern is to properly identify and characterize potentially life-threatening conditions, such as myocardial infarction, acute pulmonary embolism, or tension pneumothorax that requires urgent management. Some diagnostic features are listed in the table below.

In the appropriate clinical setting, some patients may require echocardiography or pulmonary function testing. Many other noninvasive or invasive tests are available for the evaluation of pain believed to be of respiratory, cardiac, or gastrointestinal origin. If diagnosis remains uncertain, admission to chest pain observation units that offer a safe and effective means of care for patients with possible unstable angina who are considered to be at intermediate risk for cardiovascular events may be considered.

Dyspnea\u00a0(shortness of breath) is a common complaint of patients with pulmonary disease. Timing and acuity of onset, exacerbating and alleviating factors, and degree of functional impairment are key elements of the history. Associated symptoms such as cough, hemoptysis, chest pain, wheezing, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, as well as environmental triggers, should be elicited and are helpful in developing a differential diagnosis. If dyspnea is recent, of sudden onset, and accompanied by chest pain, then diseases such as pneumothorax, pulmonary embolism, and pulmonary edema should come to mind. If the dyspnea is long-standing and is slowly progressive, then chronic conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and neuromuscular disorders are in the differential diagnosis. The progression of chronic dyspnea may be insidious. Asking specific questions to quantify changes in functional status over time is important. Dyspnea may occur during exertion or at rest and may be episodic or continuous. Episodic dyspnea associated with exertion suggests parenchymal lung disease or cardiac dysfunction. Dyspnea that is seasonal or triggered by environmental exposure suggests diseases such as asthma and hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Positional dyspnea can occur in patients with severe obstructive lung disease, diaphragmatic paralysis, or neuromuscular weakness.", "questions": [{"question": "<p>\n <span>\n  <span>\n   A.\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  4.

Anti-IgE therapy may be beneficial in some patients.

This gene is required to regulate the components of mucus,\nsweat, and digestive juices. The disease affects several different organs, but\nmost morbidity and mortality is related to pulmonary infections. Pancreatic\ninsufficiency is also a common cause of morbidity. The hallmark symptoms are\nsalty-tasting skin; poor growth despite normal food intake; accumulation of thick,\nsticky mucus; recurrent sinus infections; frequent chest infections with\ncoughing and shortness of breath; and diarrhea. Males may be infertile because\nof congenital absence of the vas deferens. Symptoms often appear in infancy and\nchildhood. Bowel obstruction due to meconium ileus occurs in newborn babies. As\nthe child grows, he or she must struggle to expectorate thick mucus. (Ciliated\nepithelial cells have a mutated protein that results in abnormally viscous\nmucus production.) Poor growth in children is the result of chronic lung\ninfection, poor absorption of nutrients through the gastrointestinal tract, and\nincreased metabolic demand due to chronic illness.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <i>\n  Primary ciliary dyskinesia\n </i>\n (\n <i>\n  <span>\n   PCD\n  </span>\n </i>\n ), also known as\n <span>\n  immotile ciliary syndrome\n </span>\n or\n <span>\n  Kartagener&rsquo;s Syndrome,\n </span>\n is a rare,\nautosomal recessive disorder characterized by impaired ciliary action along the\nlining of the respiratory tract and fallopian tubes.

In PCD, ciliary dysfunction results in impaired mucus\nclearance, which predisposes the patient to sinusitis, bronchitis, otitis\nmedia, bronchiectasis, and pneumonia. Infertility is common because of\ndefective ciliary action in the fallopian tubes and diminished sperm motility.\n50% of individuals with PCD develop situs inversus, where the laterality of the\ninternal organs is the mirror-image of normal.

In these\nconditions, the kidney responds as if the body were truly hypovolemic.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n There are several volume and\npressure sensing systems that influence ECF and ECV. If they contract then\nvolume preserving systems become active, and if they expand then volume\ndepletion systems become active. Volume sensors, also known as low pressure\nbaroreceptors, are located in the atria, right ventricle, and large pulmonary\nvessels. They become active when the blood volume increases; in essence they\nsense fullness of the vascular system. When active, these volume sensors send\nneural activity to the brainstem via the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves,\nresulting in decreases in sympathetic nerve activity and antidiuretic hormone\n(ADH) secretion; these effects will enhance the excretion of sodium and water.\nAtrial and ventricular cells also secrete atrial natriuretic peptide and brain\nnatriuretic peptide, respectively, when volume is high, resulting in sodium and\nwater excretion and reduction of ADH secretion.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n High pressure baroreceptors\nare located in the carotid sinus, aortic arch, and the juxtaglomerular (JG)\napparatus of the kidneys. The baroreceptor reflex increases sympathetic\nactivity to the vasculature if blood pressure decreases and vice versa to\nincrease or decrease vascular tone, respectively, to control blood pressure. In\naddition, changes in sympathetic activity alter excretion of sodium and water.\nIncreasing sympathetic activity directly increases renin secretion from\njuxtaglomerular cells; the resultant increase in angiotensin II produces\nvasoconstriction, and the secretion of aldosterone elicited by angiotensin II\nenhances salt and water reabsorption by the kidneys. JG cells directly detect\nthe lower perfusion pressure that occurs when blood pressure decreases and\nrespond by secreting renin. Glomerular filtration rate also decreases with\nlower perfusion pressure and the resultant sympathetic-mediated constriction of\nafferent and efferent arterioles which reduces delivery of NaCl to the macula\ndensa, and this process (tubuloglomerular feedback) also enhances renin\nsecretion.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Hepatic cirrhosis is\nassociated with decreased albumin in plasma, which results in edema due to a\nreduction in plasma oncotic pressure. Edema reduces ECV which the pressure and\nvolume sensors interpret as a contraction (reduction) of ECV. Thus, volume\nconserving mechanisms become active. The net effect is relatively more\nconservation of water than salt, resulting in hyponatremia.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Congestive heart failure\ncauses a reduction in cardiac output and thus ECV. The resultant decrease in\nblood pressure activates volume conserving systems which overfill the vascular\nsystem, causing jugular venous distension, pulmonary crackles, edema, and\nabnormal cardiac findings.\n</p>\n", "choices": ["A.

The main types of non-small cell lung cancer are squamous cell\ncarcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and large cell carcinoma. Squamous cell carcinoma\nusually starts near a central bronchus.

Formerly known as \"oat\ncell\" carcinoma, small cell cancer usually arises in the large airways,\nand grows rapidly. Despite being more sensitive to chemotherapy and radiation\nthan other histologic types, small cell cancer is often metastatic at\npresentation and carries a worse prognosis. It is strongly associated with\nsmoking. The cancer cells contain dense neurosecretory vesicles, which contain\nneuroendocrine hormones.

However, the most common cause is\nrespiratory distress syndrome (RDS), also known as\n  <span>\n   hyaline membrane disease\n  </span>\n  because of the formation of &ldquo;membranes&rdquo;\nin the peripheral air spaces of infants who succumb to this condition.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  RDS is basically a disease of premature infants\n  <i>\n   .\n  </i>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Other contributing\ninfluences are\n  <span>\n   maternal diabetes,\ncesarean section\n  </span>\n  before the onset of labor, and\n  <span>\n   twin gestation.\n  </span>\n  The fundamental defect in RDS is the inability of\nthe immature lung to synthesize sufficient surfactant. Surfactant is a complex\nof surface-active phospholipids, principally dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine\n(lecithin), and at least two groups of surfactant-associated proteins.\nSurfactant is synthesized by type II pneumocytes. With the healthy newborn&rsquo;s\nfirst breath, it rapidly coats the surface of alveoli, reducing surface tension\nand decreasing the pressure required to keep alveoli open. In a lung deficient\nin surfactant, alveoli tend to collapse, and a relatively greater inspiratory\neffort is required with each breath to open the alveoli. Thus, surface tension\nis increased and lung compliance is decreased. The infant rapidly tires from\nbreathing, and generalized atelectasis sets in. The resulting hypoxia sets into\nmotion a sequence of events that lead to epithelial and endothelial damage and\neventually to the formation of hyaline membranes.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n RDS begins shortly after\nbirth and is manifested by tachypnea, tachycardia, chest wall retractions\n(recession), expiratory grunting, nasal flaring, and cyanosis during breathing\nefforts. As the disease progresses, the baby may develop ventilatory failure\n(rising carbon dioxide levels in the blood), and prolonged cessations of\nbreathing (apnea). Findings include hypotension and acidosis. Radiographic\nfindings include low lung volumes, diffuse reticulogranular pattern\n(homogeneous ground-glass appearance) due to diffuse alveolar atelectasis and\nair bronchograms due to alveolar collapse. The disorder may be associated with\nother conditions that accompany prematurity, such as\n <span>\n  patent ductus arteriosus, intraventricular hemorrhage,\n </span>\n and\n <span>\n  necrotizing enterocolitis.\n </span>\n The\nclinical course for the acute disease lasts about 2 to 3 days. During the first\nday, the patient worsens and requires more support. During the second day, the\nbaby may be remarkably stable on adequate support. Resolution is noted during\nthe third day, heralded by a prompt diuresis.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <a name=\"4-u1.0-B978-1-4160-2973-1..50010-7--f22\">\n </a>\n <a name=\"4-u1.0-B978-1-4160-2973-1..50010-7--cese\">\n </a>\n <span>\n  A major thrust in the control of RDS focuses on\nprevention, either by delaying labor until the fetal lung reaches maturity or\nby inducing maturation of the lung in the fetus at risk. Critical to these\nobjectives is the ability to assess fetal lung maturity accurately.

most common cause of secondary\nhypertension. Hypertension is present in more than 85% of patients with chronic\nkidney disease and is a major factor causing their increased cardiovascular\nmorbidity and mortality. The mechanisms causing the hypertension include an\nexpanded plasma volume and peripheral vasoconstriction. The peripheral\nvasoconstriction is caused by both activation of vasoconstrictor pathways\n(renin-angiotensin and sympathetic nervous systems) and inhibition of vasodilator\npathways (nitric oxide). Renal insufficiency should be considered when there is\nproteinuria by dipstick or when the serum creatinine level is greater than 1.2\nmg/dL in hypertensive women or greater than 1.4 mg/dL in hypertensive men.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <u>\n  <span>\n   Renovascular Hypertension\n  </span>\n </u>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  The main causes of renal artery stenosis are atherosclerosis\n(85% of cases), typically in older persons with other clinical manifestations\nof systemic atherosclerosis, and fibromuscular dysplasia (15% of cases),\ntypically in women between the ages of 15 and 50 years. Renal artery stenosis\nleads to underperfusion of the juxtaglomerular cells, thereby producing\nrenin-dependent hypertension. The following clinical clues increase the\nsuspicion of renovascular hypertension: any hospitalization for urgent or\nemergent hypertension; recurrent &ldquo;flash&rdquo; pulmonary edema; recent worsening of\nlong-standing, previously well controlled hypertension; severe hypertension in\na young woman or in an older adult after the age of 50 years; precipitous and\nprogressive worsening of renal function in response to angiotensin-converting\nenzyme (ACE) inhibition or angiotensin II receptor blockade; unilateral small\nkidney; extensive peripheral arteriosclerosis; and a flank bruit.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <u>\n  <span>\n   Coarctation of the aorta\n  </span>\n </u>\n <span>\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Coarctation of the aorta typically occurs just distal to the\norigin of the left subclavian artery, so the blood pressure is lower in the\nlegs than in the arms (opposite of the normal situation)\n  <a name=\"4-u1.0-B978-1-4160-2805-5..50071-9--intr\">\n  </a>\n  .

Cushing's disease refers to one specific cause of the syndrome, a tumor\n(adenoma) in the pituitary gland that produces large amounts of ACTH, which in\nturn elevates cortisol. It is the most common cause of Cushing's syndrome,\nresponsible for 70% of cases, excluding glucocorticoid-related cases.

It also causes disease in the outpatient setting. Prior antibiotic\nexposure remains the most significant risk factor for developing the disease.\nSeveral synonyms are used for diseases attributable to\n <em>\n  C. difficile\n </em>\n infections (CDI):\n <em>\n  C. difficile\n </em>\n &ndash;associated diarrhea,\nantibiotic-associated colitis,\n <em>\n  C. difficile\n </em>\n colitis, and\npseudomembranous colitis.\n <em>\n  C. difficile\n </em>\n accounts for up to 25% of\nnosocomial antibiotic-associated diarrhea. The term &ldquo;pseudomembranous&rdquo; refers\nto the exudate that appears in the colon. In the last decade, an increasing\nnumber of CDIs have been reported, and the proportion of cases complicated by\nsevere outcomes has increased. This may be due to the spread of virulent\nstrains.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  The condition is usually caused by antibiotic therapy.\nAntibiotics favor overgrowth and colonization of the intestine by\n  <i>\n   Clostridium\ndifficile\n  </i>\n  <span>\n   , which\n  </span>\n  causes\ndamage by releasing toxins. Almost any antibiotic can lead to pseudomembranous\ncolitis. Fluoroquinolones, macrolides, clindamycin, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase\ninhibitors, and all generations of cephalosporins have been associated with\nCDI. Symptoms typically develop 5-10 days after initiation of antibiotic\ntherapy; however, symptoms can develop after a single day of antibiotic use or\ncan occur as late as 10 weeks after antibiotic cessation. Both increased length\nof antimicrobial use and use of multiple antimicrobials increase the risk of\nCDI. Some patients may develop CDI without a clearly identified antibiotic\nexposure.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <i>\n  C. difficile\n </i>\n produces two similar toxins that disrupt the barrier\nfunction of the colonic mucosa. Toxin A is an enterotoxin that binds to\nreceptors in the bowel wall, leading to activation of the inflammatory cascade\nand disruption of the intercellular tight junctions, causing fluid secretion,\nmucosal injury, edema, and inflammation. Toxin B is a cytotoxin that causes\nmucosal injury and further activation of the inflammatory cascade.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The clinical presentation of\nCDI ranges from self-limited diarrhea to severe colitis complicated by toxic\nmegacolon or colonic perforation. The classic presentation is cramping\nabdominal pain with profuse, mucoid, malodorous, watery stools. Fever,\nabdominal pain, and leukocytosis are common. Oral metronidazole and oral\nvancomycin are used to treat CDI. Metronidazole, which is much less expensive\nthan vancomycin, is the drug of choice for mild-to-moderate CDI.

Ulcerative colitis is characterized by\ninflammation and ulceration confined to the colonic mucosa. Crohn&rsquo;s disease is\nmanifested by transmural inflammation and granulomas affecting any segment of\nthe GI tract, including the colon. Ulcerative colitis invariably involves the\nrectum and extends proximally without skipping segments. Crohn&rsquo;s disease causes\ndiscontinuous, patchy inflammation of the GI tract, usually involving the small\nbowel, ileum, and colon. N\n </span>\n <span>\n  ewly diagnosed IBD has its peak incidence in the second\ndecade of life, with the vast majority of new cases occurring in people aged\n15-40 years.\n </span>\n <span>\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Crohn&rsquo;s disease is an\nidiopathic, chronic, transmural inflammatory process of the bowel that often\nleads to fibrosis and obstructive symptoms and can affect any part of the\ngastrointestinal tract from the mouth to the anus. Approximately 30% of Crohn&rsquo;s\ndisease cases involve the small bowel, particularly the terminal ileum, another\n30% involve the colon alone, and 40% involve both the small bowel and colon.\nThe characteristic presentation of Crohn&rsquo;s disease is abdominal pain and\ndiarrhea, which may be complicated by intestinal fistulization, obstruction, or\nboth. Additional findings may include malnutrition and bone demineralization.\nUnpredictable flares and remissions characterize the long-term course of this\ndisease. Microscopically, focal inflammatory infiltrates form around the\ncrypts. Ulceration of the superficial mucosa occurs and crypt abscesses\ndevelop. Later, inflammatory cells invade the deep mucosal layers and form noncaseating\ngranulomas. The granulomas extend through all layers of the intestinal wall and\ninto the mesentery and regional lymph nodes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Ulcerative colitis is a\nchronic, idiopathic condition characterized by inflammation of the colon.\nPatients typically have rectal bleeding, frequent stools, and mucous discharge\nwith or without tenesmus. Acute and chronic inflammation of the lamina propria,\ncrypt branching, and villous atrophy occur. There is discharge of mucus from\ngoblet cells. Ulcers appear and are soon covered by granulation tissue.\nExcessive fibrosis is not a feature of the disease. Mucosal ulceration with\nexcessive granulation tissue results in polypoidal mucosal excrescences, called\n&ldquo;pseudopolyps.&rdquo;\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <b>\n  <span>\n   Ischemic colitis\n  </span>\n </b>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Ischemic colitis\n </span>\n is a condition caused by an inadequate blood\nsupply to the colon.

The most common symptoms are abdominal pain (often left-sided)\nand mild to moderate rectal bleeding. The pain may be out of proportion to\nabdominal tenderness. In its mildest form, mucosal and submucosal edema and\nhemorrhage occur, sometimes with mild necrosis and ulceration. With severe\nischemia, findings resembling inflammatory bowel disease (i.e. ulcerations,\ncrypt abscesses and pseudopolyps) may be present.

Rarely, the esophagus and stomach are involved,\ncausing dysphagia, abdominal pain, and vomiting.

The granulosa cells secrete estrogen, which\nstimulates endothelial growth. In the late follicular phase, FSH levels\ndecline, ensuring that only the most advanced follicle will proceed to\novulation.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <a name=\"4-u1.0-B978-1-4160-2805-5..50261-5--f1\">\n </a>\n <b>\n  <span>\n   Ovulatory Phase\n  </span>\n </b>\n <span>\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Positive estrogen\nfeedback on the pituitary leads to an LH surge, which results in follicular\nmaturation and ovulation. During ovulation, an ovum is released from the mature\nfollicle. Some women experience brief, dull, unilateral pelvic pain near the\ntime of ovulation, termed\n  <i>\n   Mittelschmerz\n  </i>\n  , which may be due to leakage of\nfollicular fluid into the abdominal cavity. At peak LH levels, estrogen levels\nbegin to fall and progesterone levels begin to rise.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <b>\n  <span>\n   Luteal\n(Postovulatory) Phase\n  </span>\n </b>\n <span>\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  After ovulation, the\nfollicle transforms into the corpus luteum, which produces progesterone and\nestradiol. Progesterone converts the endometrium to its secretory stage,\npreparing the uterus for implantation. Progesterone levels peak a week after\nthe LH surge, and fall if pregnancy has not occurred. Similar (but smaller)\nchanges in estrogen occur.\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;\n  </span>\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  EFFECTS\nON TARGET ORGANS\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <b>\n  <span>\n   Endometrium\n  </span>\n </b>\n <span>\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Menstrual bleeding\noccurs when the corpus luteum stops secreting progesterone. After menses, the\nbasal layer of the endometrium regenerates the superficial layer of epithelial\ncells lining the uterine cavity and an intermediate layer of spongiosa, both of\nwhich are shed at each menstruation. Endometrial glands in these layers\nproliferate under the influence of estrogen in the follicular phase so that the\nmucosa thickens. In the luteal phase, under the influence of progesterone, the\nglands become coiled and secretory. As both estradiol and progesterone decline\nin the late luteal phase, endometrial necrosis occurs and bleeding ensues.\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;\n  </span>\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <b>\n  <span>\n   Cervix and Cervical\nMucus\n  </span>\n </b>\n <span>\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  During the follicular\nphase, cervical vascularity, congestion, and edema increase under the influence\nof estrogen. The external cervical os opens to a diameter of 3 mm at ovulation\nand then decreases to 1 mm. Cervical mucus increases in quantity (10- to\n30-fold) and in elasticity. Under the influence of progesterone during the\nluteal phase, cervical mucus thickens and loses its elasticity.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <b>\n  <span>\n   Vagina\n  </span>\n </b>\n <span>\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  When estrogen levels are\nlow, the vaginal epithelium is pale and thin. During the follicular phase,\nunder the influence of estrogen, the epithelium thickens, and the number of\nmature cornified cells increases. During the luteal phase, there is an increase\nin cellular debris and clumping of shed desquamated cells.\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;\n  </span>\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <b>\n  <span>\n   Ovary\n  </span>\n </b>\n <span>\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  During the reproductive\nyears, the ovaries regularly produce a single dominant follicle, which grows\nand matures during the follicular phase.

</span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The\n <span>\n  loop of Henle\n </span>\n is the portion of the nephron that extends from the\nproximal convoluted tubule to the distal convoluted tubule. The loop has a\nhairpin bend in the renal medulla. Its main function is to create a\nconcentration gradient in the medulla. By means of a countercurrent multiplier\nsystem using sodium pumps, an area of high sodium concentration is created in\nthe medulla. This increases the tonicity of the medulla. The hypertonic medulla\nthen passively draws water from the filtrate, concentrating the urine.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The loop of Henle consists\nof a descending and an ascending limb. The descending limb is permeable to\nwater. As the filtrate travels down the descending limb in the hypertonic\nmedulla, water flows out freely until the tonicity of the filtrate and\ninterstitium equilibrate. The thick ascending limb, by contrast, is impermeable\nto water. It actively absorbs sodium from the filtrate and delivers it to the\nmedullary interstitium, raising its tonicity. The hypertonic interstitium then\npassively draws water from the descending limb and collecting ducts.\n <span>\n  &nbsp;\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Cells in the thick ascending\nloop of Henle use the\n <span>\n  Na-K-2Cl\n  <b>\n  </b>\n  transporter\n </span>\n to reabsorb sodium. This transporter resides in the apical membrane of cells\nlining the thick ascending limb. (The apical membrane is on the luminal side).\nFor each molecule of sodium absorbed, a molecule of potassium and two molecules\nof chloride are also absorbed. Hence, the designation: Na-K-2Cl. (Na, K, and Cl\nare transported in the same direction, i.e., from the filtrate into the cell.)\n <span>\n  &nbsp;\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Furosemide (Lasix) and other\nloop diuretics inhibit the Na-K-2Cl transporter in the thick ascending limb of\nthe loop of Henle. This impairs sodium absorption, which is needed to raise the\ntonicity of the medullary interstitium. By inhibiting sodium absorption,\nfurosemide decreases the tonicity (osmolarity) of the medullary interstitium.\nTonicity drives water absorption in the descending limb of the loop. By\ndecreased the tonicity of the medullary interstitium, furosemide decreases\nwater absorption in the descending limb.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <b>\n  Answer A is correct\n </b>\n . Furosemide inhibits the Na-K-2Cl transporter\nin the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. This reduces sodium\nabsorption. Normally, sodium is absorbed and delivered to the medullary\ninterstitium, raising its osmolarity. By inhibiting sodium absorption,\nfurosemide reduces the osmolarity of the medullary interstitium. That\nosmolarity drives passive water absorption from the descending limb of the\nloop. When the osmolarity of the interstitium is reduced after administration\nof furosemide, sodium absorption in the descending limb is reduced as well.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  A\n38-year-old man notices dark urine after running a 15-km race.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Urinalysis\nshows:\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Specific\ngravity:\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  </span>\n  1.010\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Dipstick\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Glucose:\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  </span>\n  negative\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Blood:\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  </span>\n  positive\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Nitrates:\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  </span>\n  negative\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Microscopic\nexamination\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  WBC\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  </span>\n  negative\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  RBC\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  </span>\n  negative\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Which of\nthe following is the most likely cause of these findings?\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  A.

Contact\nallergens are soluble haptens (low in molecular weight) that cross the stratum\ncorneum of the skin. They can elicit an immune response only as part of a\ncomplete antigen, which requires their association with epidermal proteins to\nform hapten-protein conjugates. These conjugates are recognized as foreign\nbodies by Langerhans cells, which internalize the protein; transport it through\nthe lymphatic system to regional lymph nodes; and present it to T-lymphocytes.\nThis process is controlled by cytokines and chemokines. As the Langerhans cells\nare transported to the lymph nodes, they differentiate into dendritic cells,\nwhich are immunostimulatory. In lymph glands, dendritic cells present the\nepitope to the T-lymphocytes, which differentiate and multiply so that they can\nrespond quickly and aggressively if the allergen appears again.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <b>\n  Dermatomyositis\n </b>\n is associated with a heliotrope rash, a violaceous\ndiscoloration of the upper and lower eyelids and periorbital skin, usually with\nedema.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <b>\n  Seborrheic dermatitis\n </b>\n is an inflammatory disorder of the scalp, face, and trunk that produces red,\nitchy, flaky skin.
