The classic form involves\nprior sensitization to an allergen with later re-exposure, producing symptoms\nvia an immunologic mechanism. The most common organ systems involved include\nthe cutaneous, respiratory, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal systems. The\nfull-blown syndrome includes urticaria (hives) and/or angioedema with\nhypotension and bronchospasm.\n <span>\n  &nbsp;\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Traditionally, the term\n&ldquo;anaphylaxis&rdquo; is reserved for reactions mediated by immunoglobulin E (IgE), and\nthe term &ldquo;anaphylactoid&rdquo; is reserved for IgE-independent events (which are\nclinically indistinguishable). Anaphylaxis is a type I hypersensitivity response.\nIgE production requires the secretion of cytokines from T\n <sub>\n  H\n </sub>\n 2 cells.\nThese cytokines induce B cells to switch antibody production to the IgE\nclass.\n <span>\n  &nbsp;\n </span>\n The IgE binds to Fc\uf065\nreceptors on mast cells. When the antigen-binding region of IgE is cross-linked\nby allergens, mast cell degranulation occurs, resulting in anaphylaxis.\n <span>\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The physiologic responses to\nthe release of anaphylaxis mediators include smooth muscle spasm in the\nrespiratory and gastrointestinal (GI) tracts, vasodilation, increased vascular\npermeability, and stimulation of sensory nerve endings. Increased mucous\nsecretion and increased bronchial smooth muscle tone, as well as airway edema,\ncontribute to the respiratory symptoms. Cardiovascular effects result from\ndecreased vascular tone and capillary leakage. Hypotension, cardiac\narrhythmias, syncope, and shock may result from intravascular volume loss,\nvasodilation, and myocardial dysfunction. These physiologic events lead to some\nor all of the classic symptoms of anaphylaxis: flushing; urticaria/angioedema;\npruritus; bronchospasm; laryngeal edema; abdominal cramping with nausea,\nvomiting, and diarrhea; and feeling of impending doom.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Anaphylaxis is a medical\nemergency that requires immediate recognition and intervention. Patients should\nreceive high-flow oxygen, cardiac monitoring, and intravenous access.\nEpinephrine maintains blood pressure, antagonizes the effects of the released mediators,\nand inhibits further release of mediators. Use of epinephrine for anaphylaxis\nhas no absolute contraindications. It is the drug of choice and it is usually\nwell tolerated and potentially lifesaving.

Gout is definitively diagnosed by demonstration\nof urate crystals in aspirated synovial fluid.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Acute monoarticular\narthritis is the initial presentation in 90% of patients. Podagra, inflammation\nof the first metatarsophalangeal joint, is the initial joint manifestation in\n50% of cases (Figure 1). The attack begins abruptly and reaches maximum\nintensity within 8-12 hours. The joint is red, hot, and exquisitely tender;\neven a bed sheet on the swollen joint is uncomfortable. Untreated, the first\nattack resolves spontaneously in less than 2 weeks. Acute flares of gout can be\nprecipitated by events that raise serum uric acid levels, such as consumption\nof beer or liquor, overconsumption of high-purine foods, trauma, hemorrhage,\ndehydration, or the use of medications that raise uric acid levels (e.g.,\nthiazide diuretics).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Patients with gout are much\nmore likely to develop renal stones than are healthy individuals (by a factor\nof 1000). Although patients with gout often have other risk factors for renal\ndisease (e.g., hypertension and diabetes), chronic urate nephropathy can itself\ncontribute to renal insufficiency. Although gout typically causes joint\ninflammation, it can also cause inflammation of bursae and tendons. Tophi are\ncollections of urate crystals in the soft tissues. They can develop in patients\nwith untreated gout and may appear as lumps or nodules. While the classic\nlocation of tophi is along the helix of the ear, they can be found in other\nlocations, such as the fingers, toes, and olecranon bursae.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Gout is managed in three\nstages: (1) treating the acute attack, (2) providing prophylaxis to prevent\nacute flares, and (3) lowering excess stores of urate to prevent gouty flares\nand tissue deposition of urate crystals.

The occurrence of multiple pulmonary nodules in\n    patients with RA and pneumoconiosis is known as&nbsp;\n        <i>\n         Caplan syndrome.\n        </i>\n        &nbsp;Pleuritis,\n    pericarditis, and interstitial lung fibrosis occur in a few patients;\n    pericarditis can be severe, and acute interstitial lung disease can be\n    associated with pulmonary hemorrhage. Vasculitis, associated with\n    circulating complexes of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and rheumatoid factor (RF),\n    leads to cutaneous lesions, including ulcers and skin necrosis, and\n    mononeuritis multiplex.

Extra-articular manifestations of\n    RA are more commonly seen among patients who test positive for RF. Even in\n    patients without vasculitis or pulmonary or pleuropericardial disease, the\n    mortality rate in RA is increased by a variety of causes, including side effects\n    of therapy and infection. Premature and accelerated atherosclerosis is an\n    increasingly recognized problem among patients with RA and is thought, at\n    least, to be partially a result of the effects of chronic inflammation.\n       </span>\n      </p>\n     </td>\n    </tr>\n   </table>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n</table>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common inflammatory\narthritis. It affects women 2.5 times more than men. It can occur at any age\nbut has a peak incidence in the fourth and fifth decades of life. It is\nassociated with autoantibodies including rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic\ncitrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies. High titers of RF and anti-CCP predict\naggressive erosive disease with more extra-articular manifestations (rheumatoid\nnodules, pulmonary involvement, eye disease, Felty&rsquo;s syndrome, pericarditis,\nmyositis, and vasculitis).\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  RF is found in 75-85% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.\nRF is an antibody directed against the Fc portion of other antibodies. Low\nlevels of RF are found in hepatitis C with cryoglobulinemia, subacute\nendocarditis, and primary biliary cirrhosis. Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide\nantibodies (anti-CCP) are found in nearly 70% of patients with rheumatoid\narthritis.\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;\n  </span>\n  They are detectable in\nabout 35% of patients who are RF-negative, and may precede the diagnosis of\nrheumatoid arthritis by as many at 10 years.\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;\n  </span>\n  Citrullination occurs when arginine\nresidues on proteins (typically vimentin or fillagrin) are deiminated by the\nenzyme peptidylarginine deiminase. The modified proteins become more antigenic,\nleading to autoantibody formation.

First, insoluble calcium salts (primarily\nhydroxyapatite) provide the structural characteristics that allow bones to\nprotect internal organs, to bear weight, and to function as the levers on which\nmuscles act during locomotion. Second, soluble calcium ions in the\nextracellular fluid (ECF) and cytosol are critical for a myriad of biochemical\nreactions, signaling cascades, and electrical systems that are necessary for\nlife.\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Most of the calcium in the body (about 99%) is found in\nbone. Only 1% is contained within the ECF and soft tissues. Therefore, the\nskeleton is called on as a source of calcium when the ECF concentration falls.\nOf the total circulating calcium, the ionized fraction is about 50%, with the\nremainder bound to serum proteins, primarily albumin.

If the calcium level falls below the physiologic\nrange, PTH is rapidly secreted from the parathyroid glands and activates the\nrelease of calcium and phosphate from the skeleton.

The five major types of\nadaptation are atrophy, hypertrophy, hyperplasia, dysplasia, and metaplasia.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <b>\n  Atrophy\n </b>\n is a decrease\nin cell size. If enough cells in an organ atrophy, the entire organ will\ndecrease in size. Thymus atrophy in childhood is an example of physiologic\natrophy. Skeletal muscle atrophy is a pathologic adaptation to skeletal muscle\ndisuse. Tissue and organs especially susceptible to atrophy include skeletal\nmuscle, cardiac muscle, secondary sex organs, and the brain.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <b>\n  Hypertrophy\n </b>\n is an\nincrease in cell size. If enough cells of an organ hypertrophy, the organ\nitself will enlarge. The heart and kidneys are especially susceptible to\nhypertrophy. Hypertrophy may be caused by mechanial signals (e.g., stretch) or\ntrophic signals (e.g., growth factors). Physiologic hypertrophy occurs in\nskeletal muscle with sustained weight-bearing exercise. Pathologic hypertrophy\noccurs in cardiac muscle as a result of hypertension.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <b>\n  Hyperplasia\n </b>\n is an\nincrease in the number of cells due to increased cell mitosis. Physiologic\nhyperplasia may be compensatory or hormonal. Compensatory hyperplasia permits\ntissue and organ regeneration. It is common in epithelial cells of the\nepidermis and intestine, hepatocytes, bone marrow cells, and fibroblasts.\nHormonal hyperplasia occurs mainly in organs that depend on estrogen (e.g.,\nendometrial cells during pregnancy). Pathologic hyperplasia is an abnormal\nincrease in cell division (e.g., endometriosis).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <b>\n  Metaplasia\n </b>\n occurs\nwhen a differentiated cell type is replaced by another cell type, which may be\nless differentiated. It is a reversible process. Metaplasia occurs in the\nrespiratory tract as a response to smoking. Bronchial cells convert from\nmucus-secreting, ciliated, columnar epithelium to non-mucous-secreting,\nnon-ciliated, squamous epithelium. The cells may become dysplasic or cancerous\nif the stimulus (e.g., cigarette smoking) is not removed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <b>\n  Dysplasia\n </b>\n refers to\nabnormal changes in cellular shape, size, and organization. Sometimes called\n\"atypical hyperplasia,&rdquo; dysplasia is not a true adaptation but, rather,\nthe earliest pre-cancerous lesion recognizable in a biopsy. Tissues prone to\ndysplasia include cervical and respiratory epithelia. Dysplasia can be mild (low-grade),\nmoderate, or severe (high-grade). Mild dysplasia is at low risk of transforming\ninto cancer. Severe dysplasia is at high risk. In most organs, carcinoma\n <i>\n  in situ\n </i>\n (CIS) is synonmyous with severe\n(high-grade) dysplasia. CIS immediately precedes the development of frank\ncarcinoma and resembles invasive carcinoma except for the lack of basement\nmembrane disruption.\n <span>\n  &nbsp;\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span class=\"search-hit\">\n  Dysplasia\n </span>\n is encountered principally in epithelia, and it is characterized by a\nconstellation of changes that\n <span>\n  include\na loss in the uniformity of the individual cells as well as a loss in their\narchitectural orientation\n </span>\n . Dysplastic cells exhibit considerable\npleomorphism and often contain large hyperchromatic nuclei with a high\nnuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio. The architecture of the tissue may be disorderly.\nFor example, in squamous epithelium the usual progressive maturation of tall\ncells in the basal layer to flattened squamous cells on the surface may be lost\nand replaced by a scrambling of dark basal-appearing cells throughout the epithelium.\nMitotic figures are more abundant than usual. Frequently, they appear in\nabnormal locations within the epithelium. For example, in dysplastic stratified\nsquamous epithelium, mitoses are not confined to the basal layers but instead\nmay appear at all levels, including surface cells. When dysplastic changes are\nmarked and involve the entire thickness of the epithelium but the lesion\nremains confined by the basement membrane, it is considered a preinvasive\nneoplasm and is referred to as\n <i>\n  carcinoma in situ\n </i>\n . Once the tumor cells\nbreach the basement membrane, the tumor is said to be\n <i>\n  invasive\n </i>\n .\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n Photomicrographs\nof normal respiratory epithelium appear below.\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n <span>\n  <img alt=\"Description: respiratory epithelium\" border=\"0\" height=\"307\" src=\"static/img/tutorials/image048.png\" v:shapes=\"Picture_x0020_347184\" width=\"247\"/>\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n <span>\n  <img alt=\"Description: respiratory epithelium 2\" border=\"0\" height=\"264\" src=\"static/img/tutorials/image050.png\" v:shapes=\"Picture_x0020_347183\" width=\"353\"/>\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Respiratory epithelium\nlining the upper airways is classified as\n <i>\n  ciliated pseudostratified columnar\nepithelium.\n </i>\n Although all cells in the epithelium touch the basement\nmembrane and, therefore, comprise a single layer, the nuclei are not aligned in\nthe same plane. Thus, the epithelium appears to have several layers. The term\n&ldquo;pseudostratified&rdquo; describes this arrangement.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The majority of cells\ncomposing the\n <i>\n  ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium\n </i>\n are of three\ntypes: a) ciliated cells, b) goblet cells, and c) basal cells. The ciliated\ncells are columnar epithelial cells with specialized ciliary modifications.\nGoblet cells, so named because they are shaped like a wine goblet, are columnar\nepithelial cells that secrete mucus. The basal cells are small, nearly cuboidal\ncells that differentiate into other cells types. They respond to epithelial\ninjury by migrating to the denuded site and differentiating to restore the\nepithelial cell layer.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Some of the earliest changes\nin smoking-damaged respiratory epithelium include goblet cell hyperplasia\n <b>\n  (A)\n </b>\n ,\nbasal cell hyperplasia\n <b>\n  (B)\n </b>\n , and squamous metaplasia\n <b>\n  (C)\n </b>\n .

Glycogen accumulates in the liver and kidneys, causing enlargement of\nthese organs.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Hepatic glycogen serves as a\nform of rapidly accessible glucose, allowing blood glucose levels to be maintained\nbetween meals.

This dephosphorylation produces free glucose, which can\nbe transported out of the liver and into the blood, where it can travel to the\nbrain and other organs. Glycogenolysis can supply glucose needs for 12&ndash;18\nhours.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n When fasting continues for\nmore than a few hours, falling insulin levels permit catabolism of\ntriglycerides in adipose tissue and protein in muscle tissue. The products of\nthese processes are free fatty acids and amino acids, respectively. Free fatty\nacids are converted to acetyl-CoA, some of which is diverted to produce\nketones. Amino acids are used to synthesize new glucose-6-phosphate in liver\ncells by the process of gluconeogenesis. The last step of gluconeogenesis, like\nthe last step of glycogenolysis, is the dephosphorylation of\nglucose-6-phosphate to free glucose by glucose-6-phosphatase.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Thus, glucose-6-phosphatase\nmediates the final steps in both pathways of glucose production: glycogenolysis\nand gluconeogenesis.\n <span>\n  &nbsp;\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  The\nprincipal metabolic effects of glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency (glycogen\nstorage disease type I, or von Gierke&rsquo;s disease) are:\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   &middot;\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Hypoglycemia\n(fasting)\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   &middot;\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Lactic\nacidosis\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   &middot;\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Hyperuricemia\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   &middot;\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Hypertriglyceridemia\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;\n  </span>\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <b>\n  <span>\n   Hypoglycemia\n  </span>\n </b>\n <span>\n  is &ldquo;fasting&rdquo; or\n&ldquo;post-absorptive&rdquo; because it occurs after digestion of the meal (usually about\nfour hours later).

(The word &ldquo;myeloid&rdquo; is used to\ndescribe any leukocyte that is not a lymphocyte). AML is the most common acute\nleukemia affecting adults, and its incidence increases with age. Symptoms are\ncaused by replacement of normal bone marrow with leukemic cells, which causes a\ndrop in red blood cells, platelets, and normal white blood cells. This can\nresult in fatigue, shortness of breath, easy bruising and bleeding, and\nincreased risk of infection. Several risk factors and chromosomal abnormalities\nhave been identified, but the specific cause is not clear.

SCID are due to mutations\nin the gene encoding the common gamma chain (&gamma;\n  <sub>\n   c\n  </sub>\n  ), a protein\nthat is shared by the receptors for interleukins IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15\nand IL-21. These interleukins and their receptors are involved in the\ndevelopment and differentiation of T and B cells. Because the common gamma\nchain is shared by many interleukin receptors, mutations that result in a\nnon-functional common gamma chain cause widespread defects in interleukin\nsignaling. The result is a near complete failure of the immune system to\ndevelop and function, with low or absent T cells and NK cells and\nnon-functional B cells. The second most common form of SCID is caused by a\ndefective enzyme, adenosine deaminase (ADA), necessary for the breakdown of\npurines. Numerous other mutations are associated with SCID (including mutations\nof Janus kinase 3,\n  <i>\n   RAG-1\n  </i>\n  ,\n  <i>\n   RAG-2\n  </i>\n  ,\n  <i>\n  </i>\n  and\n  <i>\n   Artemis\n  </i>\n  ).\nSerious viral infections, lack of peripheral B and T lymphocytes, radiographic\nabsence of a thymic shadow, absence of tonsils, and absence of palpable lymph\nnodes are all consistent with a diagnosis of SCID.\n </span>\n</p>\n", "<p class=\"\">\n <b>\n  <span>\n   Answer\nA is incorrect.\n  </span>\n </b>\n <span>\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;\n  </span>\n  Patients with severe congenital\nneutropenia present with very low circulating neutrophil counts and severe\ninfections, which usually occur when the absolute neutrophil count is &lt;500\ncells/mm\n  <sup>\n   3\n  </sup>\n  .\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;\n  </span>\n  Infections\noccur in the oral and mucosal surfaces (gingivitis, periodontitis), skin,\nperirectal and genital areas, lungs, GI tract, and bloodstream.

The main types of transplant rejection are\nhyperacute, acute, and chronic.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <i>\n  Hyperacute rejection\n </i>\n usually occurs within 24 hours of\ntransplantation. The response is so quick that the graft never becomes\nvascularized. Hyperacute rejection is characterized by thrombotic occlusions\nand hemorrhages of the graft vasculature that begin minutes to hours after the\ngraft is placed. These occur because of preexisting host antibodies that bind\nto antigens present in the graft endothelium. The complement system is\nactivated and there is an influx of neutrophils. Endothelial cells and\nplatelets shed lipid particles, which promote coagulation. The resulting\ninflammation prevents vascularization of the graft. The graft suffers\nirreversible damage from ischemia.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n There are several\nexplanations for the preexisting antibodies that initiate hyperacute rejection.\nRecipients of blood transfusions sometimes develop antibodies to major\nhistocompatibility class (MHC) antigens from the transfused blood. If some of\nthese antigens match those in a graft, then hyperacute rejection may occur.\nMultiple pregnancies may also expose woman to the paternal antigens of the\nfetus, resulting in the creation of antibodies. Finally, prior recipients of\ntransplants may have already formed antibodies to other MHC antigens &ndash;\nantibodies that may be present at the time of a second transplant. Usually\nhyperacute rejection can be avoided by screening for anti-graft antibodies\n(crossmatching).\n <span>\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <i>\n  <span>\n   Acute rejection\n  </span>\n </i>\n <span>\n  usually begins a week\nafter transplantation and most likely occurs to some degree in all transplants\n(except between identical twins). It is caused by mismatched HLA antigens that\nare present on all cells. HLA antigens are polymorphic; therefore, the chance\nof a perfect match is extremely rare. The reason that acute rejection occurs a\nweek after transplantation is because the T cells involved in rejection must\ndifferentiate and the antibodies must be produced before rejection is\ninitiated. Some T cells cause graft cells to lyse; others produce cytokines\nthat recruit other inflammatory cells, eventually causing necrosis of allograft\ntissue. Endothelial cells in vascularized grafts such as kidneys are some of\nthe earliest victims of acute rejection. Damage to the endothelial lining is an\nearly predictor of irreversible acute graft failure. The risk of acute\nrejection is highest in the first three months after transplantation and is\nlowered by immunosuppressive agents. The diagnosis of acute rejection is based\non clinical data, laboratory testing, and tissue biopsy.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <i>\n  <span>\n   Chronic rejection\n  </span>\n </i>\n <span>\n  occurs months to years\nfollowing transplantation. It is characterized by graft arterial occlusions,\nwhich result from the proliferation of smooth muscle cells and the production\nof collagen by fibroblasts. This process, termed accelerated or graft\narteriosclerosis, results in fibrosis, which can cause ischemia and cell death.\nThe fibrous lesions occur without evidence of an overt cause (such as vascular\ninjury or infection), although it is hypothesized that chronic rejection is the\nresult of multiple acute rejections. This hypothesis is based on the knowledge\nthat the resulting fibrosis is similar to the fibrosis that accompanies the\nnatural healing of a wound. Now that there are treatments for acute rejection,\nchronic rejection is the major cause of graft loss. Most recipients must take\nimmunosuppressive drugs for the rest of their lives, and even that may not be\nenough to combat chronic rejection. This poses a dilemma in the trend of\nimmunotherapy, since immunosuppression is highly focused to prevent acute\nrejection and does not substantially address chronic rejection mechanisms.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <i>\n  Graft-versus-host disease\n </i>\n (GVHD) is a common complication of\nallogeneic bone marrow\n <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation\" title=\"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation\">\n </a>\n transplantation in which\nfunctional T cells in the transplanted marrow recognize the recipient as\n\"foreign\" and mount an immunologic attack.\n <i>\n  Acute\n </i>\n graft-versus-host-disease occurs within the first 100 days\nand is characterized by selective damage to the gastrointestinal tract, liver,\nand skin.

In the subsequent 10&ndash;30 minutes, the detection\nof isotope-labelled carbon dioxide in exhaled breath indicates that the urea\nwas split; this indicates that urease is present in the stomach, and hence that\n  <i>\n   H. pylori\n  </i>\n  bacteria are present.

Endotoxins are largely responsible for the dramatic clinical\nmanifestations of infections with pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria.\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n <span>\n  <img alt=\"Description: http://www.glycosan.com/images/endotoxin_structure.jpg\" border=\"0\" height=\"233\" src=\"static/img/tutorials/image196.png\" v:shapes=\"Picture_x0020_347229\" width=\"231\"/>\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n Endotoxin\n</p>\n\n<p>\n A comparison of endotoxin\nand exotoxins appears below.\n</p>\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"\">\n <tr>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Endotoxin\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Exotoxin\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Disease\n  (examples)\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Gram-negative\n  sepsis\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Tetanus,\n  Botulism, Diphtheria\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Source\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Lipopolysaccharide\n  found in the cell wall of most gram-negative bacteria; released when lysed\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Polypeptide\n  secreted by certain species of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Gene\n  location\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Bacterial\n  chromosome\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Plasmid\n  or bacteriophage\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Clinical\n  effects\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Fever,\n  shock\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Depends\n  on toxin\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Antigenicity\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Poorly\n  antigenic\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Induces\n  high-titer antibodies, called antitoxins\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Vaccines\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     None\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Toxoids\n  used as vaccines\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Heat\n  stability\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Stable\n  at 100\n     <sup>\n      o\n     </sup>\n     C for 1 hour\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Destroyed\n  rapidly at 60\n     <sup>\n      o\n     </sup>\n     C\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n</table>\n", "choices": ["<p>\n <span>\n  A.\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;\n  </span>\n </span>\n Endotoxin\n</p>\n", "<p>\n <span>\n  B.\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  </span>\n </span>\n Superantigen\n</p>\n", "<p>\n <span>\n  C.\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  </span>\n </span>\n Erythrogenic toxin\n</p>\n", "<p>\n <span>\n  D.\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;\n  </span>\n </span>\n Hemolysin\n</p>\n"]}, {"question": "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Each of\nthe following clinical vignettes describes a condition that is caused by an\nexotoxin-producing bacterium.

The best-characterized are enterotoxin (\n <span>\n  toxin A\n </span>\n ) and cytotoxin (\n <span>\n  toxin\nB\n </span>\n ), both of which cause diarrhea and inflammation. Enzyme-linked\nimmunoabsorbant assays (ELISA) are available for detecting toxins A and B in\nthe stool.

The vaccine is\ncomposed of the diphtheria toxoid.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Cholera\n </span>\n is an infection of the small intestine caused by the\nbacterium\n <i>\n  Vibrio cholerae\n </i>\n . The main symptoms are profuse watery diarrhea\nand vomiting. The diarrhea is frequently described as \"rice water.\"\nAn untreated person may produce 10-20 liters of stool a day. Disease\ntransmission is primarily through consumption of contaminated water or food.\nThe severity of the diarrhea and vomiting can lead to rapid dehydration and\nelectrolyte imbalance. Primary treatment is rehydration. Cholera affects 3-5\nmillion people worldwide and causes more than 100,000 deaths each year.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <i>\n  <span>\n   Escherichia coli\n  </span>\n </i>\n <span>\n  O157:H7\n </span>\n is an enterohemorrhagic strain of the bacterium\n <i>\n  Escherichia\ncoli\n </i>\n <span>\n  .\n </span>\n Infection often leads\nto hemorrhagic diarrhea and, occasionally, to renal failure, especially in\nyoung children and the elderly. Transmission is via the fecal-oral route.\n <i>\n  E.\ncoli\n </i>\n is a Gram-negative bacillus, of which there are hundreds of serotypes.\nMost are harmless. Serotype O157:H7, however, can produce Shiga-like toxins,\nwhich cause severe illness. In some individuals (particularly children under\nfive years of age and the elderly), infection can lead to hemolytic uremic\nsyndrome (HUS), a condition characterized by hemolytic anemia,\nthrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure. In HUS, bacterial toxins stimulate\nplatelet activation and the formation of microthrombi in arterioles and\ncapillaries. Platelets are consumed and red blood cells are damaged as they\nsqueeze through the narrowed blood vessels. This process is called\n\"microangiopathic hemolysis.\" Schistocytes, or fragments of sheared\nred blood cells, appear in the blood and are a key finding in the diagnosis of\nHUS.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Pertussis\n </span>\n , also known as\n <span>\n  whooping\ncough,\n </span>\n is a highly contagious disease caused by the bacterium\n <i>\n  Bordetella\npertussis\n </i>\n . The condition lasts about six weeks and is named after the\n\"whoop\" sound made from the inspiration of air after a cough. (The\nhigh-pitched &ldquo;whoop&rdquo; occurs mainly in infants and children.) The classic\nsymptoms are paroxysmal cough, inspiratory whoop, and post-tussive vomiting\n(after-cough vomiting). The cough is violent and has been associated with\nsubconjunctival hemorrhage, rib fracture, and syncope. Patients present with\nmild respiratory symptoms, such as sneezing, runny nose, and cough (catarrhal\nstage). After one to two weeks, the cough develops into uncontrollable fits,\neach followed by a high-pitched \"whoop\" (in younger children) or a\ngasp (in older children). This is the paroxysmal stage. The &ldquo;whoop&rdquo; or gasp\noccurs as the patient struggles to inhale. Between coughing fits, the patient\noften appears well. The pertussis vaccine, an acellular vaccine, saves many\nlives each year.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Gas gangrene\n </span>\n (also known as \"Clostridial myonecrosis\" or\n\"myonecrosis\") is a deadly form of gangrene usually caused by\n <i>\n  Clostridium\nperfringens.\n </i>\n The condition usually occurs at the site of trauma or a recent\nsurgical wound. The onset of illness is sudden and dramatic. Predisposing\nconditions include peripheral arterial disease and diabetes. Clostridia produce\nmany different toxins that can cause potentially deadly syndromes. The site of\ninfection becomes inflamed, swollen, and very tender. Palpation of the region\nelicits crackling because of subcutaneous gas. Vesicles appear which merge into\nlarge blisters. A serosanguinous discharge is common. The edge of the infected\narea may expand over minutes. High fever, tachycardia, sweating, and exquisite\npain are typical.\n <span>\n  &nbsp;\n </span>\n If the condition\nis not treated, shock ensues and death soon follows.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Toxic shock syndrome usually\nresults from infection with\n <i>\n  Staphylococcus aureus\n </i>\n <span>\n  . Patients present with\n </span>\n high fever, low blood pressure, and\nconfusion, which may progress rapidly to stupor, coma, and multi-organ failure.\nThe characteristic rash, often seen early in the course of illness, resembles\nsunburn, and can involve any region of the body, including the lips, mouth,\neyes, palms and soles. D\n <span>\n  esquamation\noccurs\n </span>\n after 10&ndash;14 days. Toxic shock syndrome is caused by a\nsuperantigen toxin, which is produced by\n <i>\n  Staphylococcus aureus\n </i>\n <span>\n  . The superantigen is called toxic shock\nsyndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1).\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Scarlet fever\n </span>\n is caused by an exotoxin (&ldquo;erythrogenic toxin&rdquo;)\nproduced by\n <i>\n  Streptococcus pyogenes\n </i>\n . The disease is characterized by high\nfever, sore throat, tonsillar exudate, cervical lymphadenopathy, bright red\ntongue (&ldquo;strawberry tongue&rdquo;), and characteristic rash. The rash is fine, red,\nand rough-textured. It usually appears on the neck and face, often leaving a\nclear unaffected area around the mouth. It then spreads to the chest, back, and\nextremities. Classic red streaks that run together (Pastia lines) appear in body\ncreases, especially the axillae, elbows, and groin. The rash blanches with\npressure and fades by the sixth day. The affected skin desquamates. Blood tests\nshow marked leukocytosis and an elevated antistreptolysin O titer. Streptococci\nmay be cultured from the throat. Two types of complications are possible:\n&ldquo;septic&rdquo; and &ldquo;immune.&rdquo; Septic complications result from bacteremia, and include\nsinusitis, pneumonia, and meningitis. Immune complications include acute\nglomerulonephritis, rheumatic fever and erythema nodosum.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Botulism\n </span>\n is a paralytic illness caused by botulinum toxin, which\nis produced by the bacterium\n <i>\n  Clostridium botulinum\n </i>\n <span>\n  . The toxin prevents the release of\nacetylcholine at motor nerve endings in the parasympathetic system. It\n </span>\n enters the body in one of three ways: by colonization of the digestive tract by\nthe bacterium, by ingestion of toxin from foods, or by bacterial wound\ncontamination.\n <span>\n  &nbsp;\n </span>\n All forms lead to\nparalysis, which typically starts with the muscles of the face and spreads to\nthe limbs. Initial manifestations include blurred vision, ptosis, loss of\nfacial expression, swallowing problems, and difficulty speaking. Severe\nbotulism can lead to respiratory failure. The autonomic nervous system may be\nimpaired, causing dry mouth, postural hypotension, and constipation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Tetanus\n </span>\n is characterized by prolonged contraction of skeletal\nmuscle. The condition is caused by a neurotoxin produced by the Gram-positive,\nanaerobic bacterium\n <i>\n  Clostridium tetani\n </i>\n . The toxin acts by binding\ninhibitory neurons, blocking the release of neurotransmitters. Infection\ngenerally occurs through wound contamination.\n <span>\n  Generalized tetanus\n </span>\n occurs in 80% of cases and follows a\ndescending pattern. The first sign is trismus (&ldquo;lockjaw&rdquo;) and facial spasm,\nfollowed by stiffness of the neck, difficulty swallowing, and rigidity of\npectoral and calf muscles. Other findings include elevated temperature,\nelevated blood pressure, rapid heart rate, and sweating. The tetanus vaccine,\ncomposed of tetanus toxoid, is very effective at preventing disease.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome\n </span>\n is induced by epidermolytic\nexotoxins A and B, which are released by\n <i>\n  Staphylococcus aureus\n </i>\n and cause\ndetachment within the epidermal layer. The exotoxins are proteases that cleave\ndesmoglein-1, which holds the granulosum and spinosum layers of the epidermis\ntogether. The disease most commonly affects neonates and usually begins with\nfever, irritability, and a faint rash. Within 1-2 days, the rash progresses to\na blistering eruption. Tissue paper-like wrinkling of the epidermis occurs and\nlarge bullae appear. As sheets of epidermis are shed, a moist erythematous base\nis revealed. Although the clinical picture is dramatic, the process usually\nends with desquamation, and healing is complete in 5-7 days.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Staphylococcal food\npoisoning is caused by enterotoxins produced by\n <em>\n  Staphylococcus aureus\n </em>\n <em>\n  <span>\n   . The bacteria multiply in\nfood, where they produce heat-resistant enterotoxins (toxins that cannot be\ndestroyed by cooking).

The majority of acute\nrespiratory and gastrointestinal infections are viral in nature.

Disruption of these barriers, which\nprovide a first line of defense, permits the invasion of pathogens.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  The acute\nphase response triggered by such disruption provides direct antimicrobial\nactivity and prompts the development of adaptive immunity mediated by\nlymphocytes and macrophages.

The body&rsquo;s\nthermoregulatory mechanisms rarely allow fevers to exceed 41&deg; C (106&deg; F).\nTemperatures exceeding 41&deg; C are often due to a drug-induced imbalance in these\nmechanisms and may cause direct cellular damage.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Fever is a\ncomplex physiologic process involving metabolic and immunologic responses.\nBacteria release cell wall products such as peptidoglycans and endotoxin, as\nwell as enterotoxins, which bind to Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on phagocytes\n(neutrophils, macrophages) and endothelial cells. As a result, pyrogenic\ncytokines such as interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor\n(TNF)-&alpha; are released into the circulation and bind to cytokine receptors\nin the hypothalamus. This stimulates the brain to produce prostaglandin E\n  <sub>\n   2\n  </sub>\n  (PGE\n  <sub>\n   2\n  </sub>\n  ) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which trigger\nneurons in the thermoregulatory center to raise the hypothalamic thermostatic\nset point. In addition, neuronal signals to the cortex prompt behavioral\nchanges to conserve heat (e.g., shivering, adding clothing).

A\n <span>\n  retrovirus\n </span>\n is an RNA virus that is\nduplicated in a host cell using the reverse transcriptase enzyme to produce DNA\nfrom its RNA genome. The DNA is then incorporated into the host cell&rsquo;s genome\nby an integrase enzyme. This allows the virus to replicate as part of the host\ncell&rsquo;s DNA. HIV is composed of two copies of single-stranded RNA, which is\nbound to reverse transcriptase, integrase, and proteins that protect the RNA\nfrom nucleases. The RNA is enclosed by a capsid, or protein shell. The capsid\nis surrounded by a matrix, which ensures the integrity of the virion. The\nmatrix, in turn, is surrounded by an envelope, which is comprised of plasma\nmembrane from the host cell and viral glycoproteins.\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  HIV\nis most commonly diagnosed by testing blood or saliva for antibodies to the\nvirus.

The inflammation\nis usually caused by microbial infection and less commonly by certain drugs.\nMeningitis can be life-threatening because of the inflammation&rsquo;s proximity to\nthe brain and spinal cord; therefore the condition is classified as a medical\nemergency.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The most common symptoms of\nmeningitis are headache and neck stiffness associated with fever, confusion or\naltered consciousness, vomiting, and an inability to tolerate light\n(photophobia) or loud noises (phonophobia). Sometimes, especially in small\nchildren, only nonspecific symptoms may be present, such as irritability and\ndrowsiness. If a rash is present, it may indicate a particular cause of\nmeningitis; for instance, meningitis caused by meningococcal bacteria may be\naccompanied by a characteristic rash.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n A lumbar puncture may be\nused to diagnose or exclude meningitis. This involves inserting a needle into\nthe spinal canal to extract a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the fluid\nthat envelops the brain and spinal cord. The CSF is then examined in a medical\nlaboratory. The usual treatment for meningitis is the prompt application of\nantibiotics (for bacterial meningitis).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Meningitis can lead to\nserious long-term consequences such as deafness, epilepsy, hydrocephalus and\ncognitive deficits, especially if not treated quickly. Some forms of meningitis\n(such as those associated with meningococci,\n <i>\n  Haemophilus influenzae\n </i>\n type\nB, pneumococci or mumps virus infections) may be prevented by immunization.\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  In adults,\na severe headache is the most common symptom of meningitis &ndash; occurring in\nalmost 90% of cases of bacterial meningitis, followed by nuchal rigidity\n(inability to flex the neck forward passively due to increased neck muscle tone\nand stiffness). The classic triad of diagnostic signs consists of nuchal\nrigidity, sudden high fever, and altered mental status; however, all three\nfeatures are present in less than half of all cases of bacterial meningitis.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Nuchal\nrigidity occurs in 70% of adult cases of bacterial meningitis. Other signs of\nmeningism include the presence of positive Kernig sign or Brudzinski sign.\nKernig sign is assessed with the patient lying supine, with the hip and knee flexed\nto 90 degrees. In a patient with a positive Kernig sign, pain limits passive\nextension of the knee. A positive Brudzinski's sign occurs when flexion of the\nneck causes involuntary flexion of the knee and hip. Although Kernig and\nBrudzinski signs are both commonly used to screen for meningitis, the\nsensitivity of these tests is limited. They do, however, have very good\nspecificity for meningitis: the signs rarely occur in other diseases.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Meningitis\ncaused by the bacterium\n  <i>\n   Neisseria meningitidis\n  </i>\n  (known as &ldquo;meningococcal\nmeningitis&rdquo;) can be differentiated from meningitis with other causes by a\nrapidly spreading petechial rash which may precede other symptoms. The rash\nconsists of numerous small, irregular purple or red spots (&ldquo;petechiae&rdquo;) on the\ntrunk, lower extremities, mucous membranes, conjuctiva, and (occasionally) the\npalms of the hands or soles of the feet. The rash is typically non-blanching:\nthe redness does not disappear when pressed with a finger or a glass tumbler.\nAlthough this rash is not necessarily present in meningococcal meningitis, it\nis relatively specific for the disease.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The types of bacteria that\ncause bacterial meningitis vary by age group. In premature babies and newborns\nup to three months old, common causes are\n <i>\n  group B streptococci\n </i>\n (which\nnormally inhabit the vagina and are mainly a cause during the first week of\nlife) and those that normally inhabit the digestive tract such as\n <i>\n  Escherichia\ncoli\n </i>\n (carrying K1 antigen).\n <i>\n  Listeria monocytogenes\n </i>\n may affect the\nnewborn and occurs in epidemics. Older children are more commonly affected by\n <i>\n  Neisseria\nmeningitidis\n </i>\n (meningococcus),\n <i>\n  Streptococcus pneumoniae\n </i>\n (serotypes 6,\n9, 14, 18 and 23) and those under five by\n <i>\n  Haemophilus influenzae\n </i>\n type B\n(mainly in countries that do not offer vaccination). In adults,\n <i>\n  N.\nmeningitidis\n </i>\n and\n <i>\n  S. pneumoniae\n </i>\n together cause 80% of all cases of\nbacterial meningitis, with increased risk of\n <i>\n  L. monocytogenes\n </i>\n in those\nover 50 years old. Since the pneumococcal vaccine was introduced, however,\nrates of pneumococcal meningitis have declined in children and adults.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Recent trauma to the skull\ngives bacteria in the nasal cavity the potential to enter the meningeal space.\nSimilarly, individuals with a cerebral shunt or related device are at increased\nrisk of infection through those devices. In these cases, infections with\nstaphylococci are more likely, as well as infections by pseudomonas and other\nGram-negative bacilli. The same pathogens are also more common in those with an\nimpaired immune system. In some people, an infection in the head and neck area,\nsuch as otitis media or mastoiditis, can lead to meningitis. Tuberculous\nmeningitis, meningitis due to infection with\n <i>\n  Mycobacterium tuberculosis\n </i>\n ,\nis more common in those from countries where tuberculosis is common, but is\nalso encountered in those with immune problems, such as AIDS.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n A literature review of 363\nreported cases of\n <i>\n  recurrent\n </i>\n meningitis showed that 59% of cases are due to anatomical abnormalities, 36%\ndue to immune deficiencies (such as complement deficiency, which predisposes\nespecially to recurrent meningococcal meningitis), and 5% due to ongoing\ninfections in areas adjacent to the meninges.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The term\n <i>\n  aseptic\nmeningitis\n </i>\n refers loosely to all cases of meningitis in which no bacterial\ninfection can be demonstrated. This is usually due to viruses, but it may be\ndue to bacterial infection that has already been partially treated, with\ndisappearance of the bacteria from the meninges, or by infection in a space\nadjacent to the meninges (e.g. sinusitis). Endocarditis (infection of the heart\nvalves with spread of small clusters of bacteria through the bloodstream) may\ncause aseptic meningitis. Aseptic meningitis may also result from infection\nwith spirochetes, a type of bacteria that includes\n <i>\n  Treponema pallidum\n </i>\n (the cause of syphilis) and\n <i>\n  Borrelia burgdorferi\n </i>\n (known for causing Lyme\ndisease). Meningitis may be encountered in cerebral malaria (malaria infecting\nthe brain). Fungal meningitis, e.g. due to\n <i>\n  Cryptococcus neoformans\n </i>\n , is\ntypically seen in people with immune deficiency such as AIDS.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Meningitis may occur as the\nresult of several non-infectious causes: spread of cancer to the meninges (\n <i>\n  malignant\nmeningitis\n </i>\n ) and certain drugs (mainly non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\nand antibiotics). It may also be caused by several inflammatory conditions such\nas sarcoidosis (which is then called neurosarcoidosis), connective tissue\ndisorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus, and certain forms of vasculitis\nsuch as Beh&ccedil;et's disease.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The most important test in\nidentifying or ruling out meningitis is analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid\nthrough lumbar puncture (LP, spinal tap). However, lumbar puncture is\ncontraindicated if there is a mass in the brain or the intracranial pressure\n(ICP) is elevated, as it may lead to brain herniation. If someone is at risk\nfor either a mass or raised ICP (recent head injury, a known immune system\nproblem, localizing neurological signs, or evidence on examination of a raised\nICP), a CT or MRI scan is recommended prior to the lumbar puncture.

The characteristic\nred, spotted, petechial rash is usually not seen until the sixth day or later,\nbut this type of rash occurs in less than 60% of patients.

Most cases are\ncaused by\n <i>\n  Borrelia burgdorferi.\n </i>\n <i>\n  Borrelia\n </i>\n is transmitted to humans\nby the bite of infected ticks belonging to the genus\n <i>\n  Ixodes\n </i>\n (&ldquo;hard\nticks&rdquo;).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Lyme disease can produce a\nrange of symptoms. The incubation period is usually one to two weeks, but can\nbe shorter (days) or longer (months to years). The disease usually occurs\nduring tick season (May to September). Asymptomatic infection occurs in less\nthan 7% of infected individuals. Early symptoms include fever, malaise,\nheadache, and muscle soreness. A classic sign is a circular, outwardly\nexpanding rash, called erythema chronicum migrans. It appears at the site of\nthe tick bite within a month of the bite. The rash is red, may be warm, and is\ngenerally painless. Classically, the innermost part is dark red and indurated\n(firm), the outer edge remains red, and the portion in between clears. This\ngives the lesion the appearance of a bullseye (see figure). Erythema chronicum\nmigrans is thought to occur in 80% of infected patients.\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n <span>\n  <img alt=\"Description: lyme-disease-rash\" border=\"0\" height=\"190\" src=\"static/img/tutorials/image268.png\" v:shapes=\"Picture_x0020_347193\" width=\"161\"/>\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Days to weeks after\ninfection, the bacteria may spread through the bloodstream. Symptoms of early\ndissemination include migrating pain in the muscles, joints, and tendons, and\nheart palpitations due to arrhythmia. Various neurological problems may occur,\nincluding facial palsy, meningitis, and encephalitis (resulting in memory loss,\nsleep disturbance, or mood change). After several months, untreated patients\nmay go on to develop chronic symptoms that affect the brain, nerves, eyes,\njoints, and heart.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The diagnosis of Lyme\ndisease is based on symptoms, objective physical findings (such as erythema\nmigrans, facial palsy, or arthritis), history of possible exposure to infected\nticks, and serological blood tests. The classic &ldquo;bullseye&rdquo; rash is considered\nsufficient to establish a diagnosis, even when serologic blood tests are\nnegative.

In\nulceroglandular fever, a tender red bump appears in the area of the tick bite.\nWithin a few weeks, the bump ulcerates.

It commonly\ncauses chickenpox in children and zoster (shingles) in adults. Primary\ninfection results in chickenpox (varicella), a highly contagious disease spread\nby coughing and sneezing and by direct contact with fluid from infected\nvesicles on the skin.\n <span>\n  &nbsp;\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Initial symptoms may include\nfever, malaise, headache, sore throat, myalgia, and itching. The chicken pox\nrash begins on the face and trunk and spreads to the extremities. Lesions start\nas 2-4 mm erythematous papules that develop an irregular outline (rose petal).\nA thin-walled, clear vesicle (dew drop) develops on top of the erythematous\narea. This &ldquo;dew drop on a rose petal&rdquo; is characteristic of chicken pox. After\n8-12 hours, the fluid gets cloudy and the vesicle breaks, leaving a crust. The\nfluid is highly contagious, but once the lesions crust over, the patient is no\nlonger infectious. The crust usually falls off after 7 days. Each lesion goes\nthrough this cycle in about 7 days, and new lesions crop up daily. Rare\ncomplications include pneumonia and encephalitis.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n When clinical symptoms have\nresolved, VZV remains dormant in the nervous system, particularly in the\ntrigeminal and dorsal root ganglia. In about 10&ndash;20% of cases, the virus\nreactivates later in life causing shingles. Shingles usually presents with pain\nand vesicular rash in a dermatomal distribution. Complications include\npostherpetic neuralgia (severe pain in the distribution of the affected nerve).\n <span>\n  &nbsp;\n </span>\n The rash described in the vignette is\ntypical of chickenpox, which is caused by the varicella-zoster virus.\n</p>\n", "choices": ["<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   A.\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Measles\n </span>\n</p>\n", "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   B.\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Rubella\n </span>\n</p>\n", "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   C.\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Herpes\nsimplex virus 1\n </span>\n</p>\n", "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   D.\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Erythrovirus\nB19\n </span>\n</p>\n", "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   E.\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Varicella-zoster\nvirus\n </span>\n</p>\n"]}, {"question": "<p>\n HIV-1 is sensitive to\nsolvents such as chloroform and 20% diethyl ether, whereas hepatitis A virus is\nresistant to such solvents.

The envelope is relatively sensitive to detergents\nand is needed to aid in attachment of the virus to the host cell. Loss of the\nenvelope results in loss of infectivity. Enveloped viruses are easily\ninactivated by routine surface cleaning and disinfection. HIV-1 has an\nenvelope; hepatitis A virus does not. This explains why HIV is more sensitive\nto detergents than hepatitis A.\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;\n  </span>\n </span>\n</p>\n"], "tutorial": "<p>\n Many viruses have an\n <span>\n  envelope\n </span>\n surrounding the protein\ncapsid. The envelope is usually derived from portions of the host cell membrane\n(which is comprised of phospholipids and proteins), but also includes virally\nderived glycoproteins. Functionally, the envelope is used by viruses to enter\nthe host cell. Glycoproteins on the surface of the envelope bind to receptor\nsites on the host&rsquo;s membrane. The viral envelope then fuses with the host&rsquo;s\nmembrane, allowing the capsid and viral genome to enter the host.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The viral envelope, which is\ncomposed of a lipid bilayer, is relatively sensitive to desiccation, heat, and\ndetergents. Consequently, enveloped viruses are easier to sterilize than\nnon-enveloped viruses. They have limited survival outside the host and\ntypically must transfer directly from host to host.\n</p>\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n <table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"\">\n  <tr>\n   <td valign=\"top\" width=\"131\">\n    <p>\n     Naked DNA viruses\n    </p>\n   </td>\n   <td valign=\"top\" width=\"216\">\n    <p>\n     Enveloped DNA viruses\n    </p>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td valign=\"top\" width=\"131\">\n    <p>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n   <td valign=\"top\" width=\"216\">\n    <p>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td valign=\"top\" width=\"131\">\n    <p>\n     Adenovirus\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     Human papillomavirus\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     Jacob-Creutzfeld\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     Parvovirus (e.g., B19)\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n   <td valign=\"top\" width=\"216\">\n    <p>\n     Hepatitis B virus\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     Herpesvirus\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     <span>\n      <span>\n       &middot;\n       <span>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n       </span>\n      </span>\n     </span>\n     Epstein-Barr virus\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     <span>\n      <span>\n       &middot;\n       <span>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n       </span>\n      </span>\n     </span>\n     Cytomegalovirus\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     <span>\n      <span>\n       &middot;\n       <span>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n       </span>\n      </span>\n     </span>\n     Herpes simplex virus 1\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     <span>\n      <span>\n       &middot;\n       <span>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n       </span>\n      </span>\n     </span>\n     Herpes simplex virus 2\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     <span>\n      <span>\n       &middot;\n       <span>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n       </span>\n      </span>\n     </span>\n     Varicella zoster virus\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     <span>\n      <span>\n       &middot;\n       <span>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n       </span>\n      </span>\n     </span>\n     Roseola virus (HHV-6)\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     <span>\n      <span>\n       &middot;\n       <span>\n        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n       </span>\n      </span>\n     </span>\n     Kaposi&rsquo;s sarcoma virus (HHV-8)\n     <span>\n      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n     </span>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     Smallpox\n    </p>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n </table>\n</div>\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n <table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"\">\n  <tr>\n   <td valign=\"top\" width=\"131\">\n    <p>\n     Naked RNA viruses\n    </p>\n   </td>\n   <td valign=\"top\" width=\"216\">\n    <p>\n     Enveloped RNA viruses\n    </p>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td valign=\"top\" width=\"131\">\n    <p>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n   <td valign=\"top\" width=\"216\">\n    <p>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td valign=\"top\" width=\"131\">\n    <p>\n     Hepatitis A virus\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     Poliovirus\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     Rhinovirus\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     Coxsackievirus\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     Norwalk virus\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     Rotavirus\n    </p>\n    <p>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n   <td valign=\"top\" width=\"216\">\n    <p>\n     Hepatitis C\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     HIV\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     Influenza\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     Parainfluenza\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     Measles\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     Mumps\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     Rubella\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     Respiratory syncitial\n  virus\n    </p>\n    <p>\n     Rabies\n    </p>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n </table>\n</div>\n", "choices": ["<p>\n <span>\n  A.\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;\n  </span>\n </span>\n Single-stranded\nRNA\n</p>\n", "<p>\n <span>\n  B.\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  </span>\n </span>\n Reverse\ntranscriptase\n</p>\n", "<p>\n <span>\n  C.\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  </span>\n </span>\n Spherical\nstructure\n</p>\n", "<p>\n <span>\n  D.\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;\n  </span>\n </span>\n Icosahedral\nsymmetry\n</p>\n", "<p>\n <span>\n  E.\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  </span>\n </span>\n Viral\nenvelope\n</p>\n"]}]}, {"section": "Heart & Lung", "questions": [{"question": "<p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Chest Pain\n </span>\n</p>\n", "answers": ["<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   A.\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  3.\nMild persistent chest pain with tenderness over a costochondral junction\nsuggests a diagnosis of costochondritis.\n </span>\n</p>\n", "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   B.\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  2.\nEsophageal rupture may be precipitated by endoscopy.\n </span>\n</p>\n", "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   C.\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  12.\nGastroesophageal reflux commonly produced &ldquo;heartburn.&rdquo;

Timing and\nacuity of onset, exacerbating and alleviating factors, and degree of functional\nimpairment are key elements of the history. Associated symptoms such as cough,\nhemoptysis, chest pain, wheezing, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,\nas well as environmental triggers, should be elicited and are helpful in\ndeveloping a differential diagnosis. If dyspnea is recent, of sudden onset, and\naccompanied by chest pain, then diseases such as pneumothorax, pulmonary\nembolism, and pulmonary edema should come to mind. If the dyspnea is\nlong-standing and is slowly progressive, then chronic conditions such as\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary\narterial hypertension, and neuromuscular disorders are in the differential\ndiagnosis. The progression of chronic dyspnea may be insidious. Asking specific\nquestions to quantify changes in functional status over time is important.\nDyspnea may occur during exertion or at rest and may be episodic or continuous.\nEpisodic dyspnea associated with exertion suggests parenchymal lung disease or\ncardiac dysfunction. Dyspnea that is seasonal or triggered by environmental\nexposure suggests diseases such as asthma and hypersensitivity pneumonitis.\nPositional dyspnea can occur in patients with severe obstructive lung disease,\ndiaphragmatic paralysis, or neuromuscular weakness.\n </span>\n</p>\n", "choices": ["<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   A.\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Acidosis (metabolic)\n </span>\n</p>\n", "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   B.\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Anemia\n </span>\n</p>\n", "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   C.\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Psychogenic\n </span>\n</p>\n", "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   D.\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Asthma\n </span>\n</p>\n", "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   E.\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Bronchogenic carcinoma\n </span>\n</p>\n", "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   F.\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Emphysema\n </span>\n</p>\n", "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   G.\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Heart failure\n </span>\n</p>\n", "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   H.\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Laryngeal dysfunction\n </span>\n</p>\n", "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   I.\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Pericardial effusion\n </span>\n</p>\n", "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   J.\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Pleural effusion\n </span>\n</p>\n", "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   K.\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Pneumonia\n </span>\n</p>\n", "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   L.\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Pneumothorax\n </span>\n</p>\n", "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   M.\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Pulmonary arterial hypertension\n </span>\n</p>\n", "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   1.\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  26-year-old woman with longstanding amphetamine\nuse presents with shortness of breath.

This gene is required to regulate the components of mucus,\nsweat, and digestive juices. The disease affects several different organs, but\nmost morbidity and mortality is related to pulmonary infections. Pancreatic\ninsufficiency is also a common cause of morbidity. The hallmark symptoms are\nsalty-tasting skin; poor growth despite normal food intake; accumulation of thick,\nsticky mucus; recurrent sinus infections; frequent chest infections with\ncoughing and shortness of breath; and diarrhea. Males may be infertile because\nof congenital absence of the vas deferens. Symptoms often appear in infancy and\nchildhood. Bowel obstruction due to meconium ileus occurs in newborn babies. As\nthe child grows, he or she must struggle to expectorate thick mucus. (Ciliated\nepithelial cells have a mutated protein that results in abnormally viscous\nmucus production.) Poor growth in children is the result of chronic lung\ninfection, poor absorption of nutrients through the gastrointestinal tract, and\nincreased metabolic demand due to chronic illness.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <i>\n  Primary ciliary dyskinesia\n </i>\n (\n <i>\n  <span>\n   PCD\n  </span>\n </i>\n ), also known as\n <span>\n  immotile ciliary syndrome\n </span>\n or\n <span>\n  Kartagener&rsquo;s Syndrome,\n </span>\n is a rare,\nautosomal recessive disorder characterized by impaired ciliary action along the\nlining of the respiratory tract and fallopian tubes. Cilia are complex\norganelles that beat synchronously in the respiratory tract, moving mucus\ntoward the throat. In PCD, ciliary dysfunction results in impaired mucus\nclearance, which predisposes the patient to sinusitis, bronchitis, otitis\nmedia, bronchiectasis, and pneumonia. Infertility is common because of\ndefective ciliary action in the fallopian tubes and diminished sperm motility.\n50% of individuals with PCD develop situs inversus, where the laterality of the\ninternal organs is the mirror-image of normal.

The\nconcept of ECV is useful for understanding cardiovascular and renal physiology.\nAlthough ECV normally varies with extracellular fluid (ECF), the two become\nuncoupled in disorders like congestive heart failure and cirrhosis. In these\nconditions, the kidney responds as if the body were truly hypovolemic.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n There are several volume and\npressure sensing systems that influence ECF and ECV. If they contract then\nvolume preserving systems become active, and if they expand then volume\ndepletion systems become active. Volume sensors, also known as low pressure\nbaroreceptors, are located in the atria, right ventricle, and large pulmonary\nvessels. They become active when the blood volume increases; in essence they\nsense fullness of the vascular system. When active, these volume sensors send\nneural activity to the brainstem via the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves,\nresulting in decreases in sympathetic nerve activity and antidiuretic hormone\n(ADH) secretion; these effects will enhance the excretion of sodium and water.\nAtrial and ventricular cells also secrete atrial natriuretic peptide and brain\nnatriuretic peptide, respectively, when volume is high, resulting in sodium and\nwater excretion and reduction of ADH secretion.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n High pressure baroreceptors\nare located in the carotid sinus, aortic arch, and the juxtaglomerular (JG)\napparatus of the kidneys. The baroreceptor reflex increases sympathetic\nactivity to the vasculature if blood pressure decreases and vice versa to\nincrease or decrease vascular tone, respectively, to control blood pressure. In\naddition, changes in sympathetic activity alter excretion of sodium and water.\nIncreasing sympathetic activity directly increases renin secretion from\njuxtaglomerular cells; the resultant increase in angiotensin II produces\nvasoconstriction, and the secretion of aldosterone elicited by angiotensin II\nenhances salt and water reabsorption by the kidneys. JG cells directly detect\nthe lower perfusion pressure that occurs when blood pressure decreases and\nrespond by secreting renin. Glomerular filtration rate also decreases with\nlower perfusion pressure and the resultant sympathetic-mediated constriction of\nafferent and efferent arterioles which reduces delivery of NaCl to the macula\ndensa, and this process (tubuloglomerular feedback) also enhances renin\nsecretion.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Hepatic cirrhosis is\nassociated with decreased albumin in plasma, which results in edema due to a\nreduction in plasma oncotic pressure. Edema reduces ECV which the pressure and\nvolume sensors interpret as a contraction (reduction) of ECV. Thus, volume\nconserving mechanisms become active. The net effect is relatively more\nconservation of water than salt, resulting in hyponatremia.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Congestive heart failure\ncauses a reduction in cardiac output and thus ECV.

<span>\n  Paraneoplastic syndromes are\n </span>\n consequences of cancer that are not\nactually due to the local presence of tumor. They are mediated by substances\nproduced by the tumor or by the immune system, and may be apparent even before\nthe tumor is visible. There are four major types of paraneoplastic syndromes:\nendocrine, neurologic, mucocutaneous, and hematologic. The main endocrine\nsyndromes appear below.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Routine laboratory studies\noften provide clues to the presence of paraneoplastic syndromes. SIADH is\nassociated with hyponatremia, Cushing syndrome is associated with\nhyperglycemia, and polycythemia is associated with an elevated hematocrit.\nThese findings can be detected with blood tests. Hypercalcemia and hypoglycemia\nare also detected with routine blood tests.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Mesothelioma is a rare form\nof cancer that develops from the protective lining that covers many of the\nbody&rsquo;s internal organs, the mesothelium. It is usually caused by exposure to\nasbestos. It most commonly occurs in the pleura, but may occur in the\nperitoneum or the pericardium. Unlike lung cancer, there is no association\nbetween mesothelioma and smoking. Symptoms include shortness of breath due to\npleural effusion, chest wall pain, and general symptoms such as weight loss.\nX-ray may reveal pleural thickening, commonly seen after asbestos exposure.

Neonatal Respiratory\nDistress Syndrome (RDS) (&ldquo;hyaline membrane disease&rdquo;) should be suspected in a\npremature newborn with respiratory distress, tachypnea, tachycardia,\nhypotension, and acidosis. The fundamental abnormality is insufficient\npulmonary surfactant produced by type II pneumocytes. This results in failure\nof the lungs to expand after birth. RDS is characterized by hyaline membranes,\nwhich consist of underdeveloped epithelial cells and plasma proteins lining the\nairways. The condition can be ameliorated by prophylactic administration of\nsteroids, surfactant therapy, and by improved ventilation techniques.\n </span>\n</p>\n"], "tutorial": "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  There are\nmany causes of respiratory distress in the newborn, including sepsis,\npneumonia, excessive sedation of the mother, fetal head injury during delivery,\naspiration of blood or amniotic fluid, and perinatal depression or intrauterine\nhypoxia brought about by a number of reasons including coiling of the umbilical\ncord about the neck (nuchal cord). However, the most common cause is\nrespiratory distress syndrome (RDS), also known as\n  <span>\n   hyaline membrane disease\n  </span>\n  because of the formation of &ldquo;membranes&rdquo;\nin the peripheral air spaces of infants who succumb to this condition.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  RDS is basically a disease of premature infants\n  <i>\n   .\n  </i>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Other contributing\ninfluences are\n  <span>\n   maternal diabetes,\ncesarean section\n  </span>\n  before the onset of labor, and\n  <span>\n   twin gestation.\n  </span>\n  The fundamental defect in RDS is the inability of\nthe immature lung to synthesize sufficient surfactant. Surfactant is a complex\nof surface-active phospholipids, principally dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine\n(lecithin), and at least two groups of surfactant-associated proteins.\nSurfactant is synthesized by type II pneumocytes. With the healthy newborn&rsquo;s\nfirst breath, it rapidly coats the surface of alveoli, reducing surface tension\nand decreasing the pressure required to keep alveoli open. In a lung deficient\nin surfactant, alveoli tend to collapse, and a relatively greater inspiratory\neffort is required with each breath to open the alveoli. Thus, surface tension\nis increased and lung compliance is decreased. The infant rapidly tires from\nbreathing, and generalized atelectasis sets in. The resulting hypoxia sets into\nmotion a sequence of events that lead to epithelial and endothelial damage and\neventually to the formation of hyaline membranes.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n RDS begins shortly after\nbirth and is manifested by tachypnea, tachycardia, chest wall retractions\n(recession), expiratory grunting, nasal flaring, and cyanosis during breathing\nefforts. As the disease progresses, the baby may develop ventilatory failure\n(rising carbon dioxide levels in the blood), and prolonged cessations of\nbreathing (apnea). Findings include hypotension and acidosis. Radiographic\nfindings include low lung volumes, diffuse reticulogranular pattern\n(homogeneous ground-glass appearance) due to diffuse alveolar atelectasis and\nair bronchograms due to alveolar collapse. The disorder may be associated with\nother conditions that accompany prematurity, such as\n <span>\n  patent ductus arteriosus, intraventricular hemorrhage,\n </span>\n and\n <span>\n  necrotizing enterocolitis.\n </span>\n The\nclinical course for the acute disease lasts about 2 to 3 days. During the first\nday, the patient worsens and requires more support. During the second day, the\nbaby may be remarkably stable on adequate support. Resolution is noted during\nthe third day, heralded by a prompt diuresis.\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <a name=\"4-u1.0-B978-1-4160-2973-1..50010-7--f22\">\n </a>\n <a name=\"4-u1.0-B978-1-4160-2973-1..50010-7--cese\">\n </a>\n <span>\n  A major thrust in the control of RDS focuses on\nprevention, either by delaying labor until the fetal lung reaches maturity or\nby inducing maturation of the lung in the fetus at risk. Critical to these\nobjectives is the ability to assess fetal lung maturity accurately. Because\npulmonary secretions are discharged into the amniotic fluid, analysis of\namniotic fluid phospholipids provides a good estimate of the level of\nsurfactant in the alveolar lining.

Hypertension is present in more than 85% of patients with chronic\nkidney disease and is a major factor causing their increased cardiovascular\nmorbidity and mortality. The mechanisms causing the hypertension include an\nexpanded plasma volume and peripheral vasoconstriction. The peripheral\nvasoconstriction is caused by both activation of vasoconstrictor pathways\n(renin-angiotensin and sympathetic nervous systems) and inhibition of vasodilator\npathways (nitric oxide). Renal insufficiency should be considered when there is\nproteinuria by dipstick or when the serum creatinine level is greater than 1.2\nmg/dL in hypertensive women or greater than 1.4 mg/dL in hypertensive men.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <u>\n  <span>\n   Renovascular Hypertension\n  </span>\n </u>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  The main causes of renal artery stenosis are atherosclerosis\n(85% of cases), typically in older persons with other clinical manifestations\nof systemic atherosclerosis, and fibromuscular dysplasia (15% of cases),\ntypically in women between the ages of 15 and 50 years. Renal artery stenosis\nleads to underperfusion of the juxtaglomerular cells, thereby producing\nrenin-dependent hypertension. The following clinical clues increase the\nsuspicion of renovascular hypertension: any hospitalization for urgent or\nemergent hypertension; recurrent &ldquo;flash&rdquo; pulmonary edema; recent worsening of\nlong-standing, previously well controlled hypertension; severe hypertension in\na young woman or in an older adult after the age of 50 years; precipitous and\nprogressive worsening of renal function in response to angiotensin-converting\nenzyme (ACE) inhibition or angiotensin II receptor blockade; unilateral small\nkidney; extensive peripheral arteriosclerosis; and a flank bruit.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <u>\n  <span>\n   Coarctation of the aorta\n  </span>\n </u>\n <span>\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Coarctation of the aorta typically occurs just distal to the\norigin of the left subclavian artery, so the blood pressure is lower in the\nlegs than in the arms (opposite of the normal situation)\n  <a name=\"4-u1.0-B978-1-4160-2805-5..50071-9--intr\">\n  </a>\n  .

Cushing's disease refers to one specific cause of the syndrome, a tumor\n(adenoma) in the pituitary gland that produces large amounts of ACTH, which in\nturn elevates cortisol. It is the most common cause of Cushing's syndrome,\nresponsible for 70% of cases, excluding glucocorticoid-related cases. Findings in\nCushing&rsquo;s syndrome include rapid weight gain, truncal obesity, &ldquo;buffalo hump,&rdquo;\n&ldquo;moon face,&rdquo; excess sweating, telangiectasia, thinning of the skin, violaceous\nstriae, proximal muscle weakness, osteoporosis, amenorrhea, decreased libido,\ninfertility, hirsutism, psychological disturbance, and hyperglycemia.\n <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cushing's_syndrome#cite_note-1#cite_note-1\">\n </a>\n <u>\n </u>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <u>\n  <span>\n   Pheochromocytoma\n  </span>\n </u>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Pheochromocytomas are rare catecholamine-producing tumors of\nthe adrenal (or sometimes extra-adrenal) chromaffin cells.

It also causes disease in the outpatient setting. Prior antibiotic\nexposure remains the most significant risk factor for developing the disease.\nSeveral synonyms are used for diseases attributable to\n <em>\n  C. difficile\n </em>\n infections (CDI):\n <em>\n  C. difficile\n </em>\n &ndash;associated diarrhea,\nantibiotic-associated colitis,\n <em>\n  C. difficile\n </em>\n colitis, and\npseudomembranous colitis.\n <em>\n  C. difficile\n </em>\n accounts for up to 25% of\nnosocomial antibiotic-associated diarrhea. The term &ldquo;pseudomembranous&rdquo; refers\nto the exudate that appears in the colon. In the last decade, an increasing\nnumber of CDIs have been reported, and the proportion of cases complicated by\nsevere outcomes has increased. This may be due to the spread of virulent\nstrains.\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  The condition is usually caused by antibiotic therapy.\nAntibiotics favor overgrowth and colonization of the intestine by\n  <i>\n   Clostridium\ndifficile\n  </i>\n  <span>\n   , which\n  </span>\n  causes\ndamage by releasing toxins. Almost any antibiotic can lead to pseudomembranous\ncolitis. Fluoroquinolones, macrolides, clindamycin, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase\ninhibitors, and all generations of cephalosporins have been associated with\nCDI. Symptoms typically develop 5-10 days after initiation of antibiotic\ntherapy; however, symptoms can develop after a single day of antibiotic use or\ncan occur as late as 10 weeks after antibiotic cessation. Both increased length\nof antimicrobial use and use of multiple antimicrobials increase the risk of\nCDI. Some patients may develop CDI without a clearly identified antibiotic\nexposure.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <i>\n  C. difficile\n </i>\n produces two similar toxins that disrupt the barrier\nfunction of the colonic mucosa. Toxin A is an enterotoxin that binds to\nreceptors in the bowel wall, leading to activation of the inflammatory cascade\nand disruption of the intercellular tight junctions, causing fluid secretion,\nmucosal injury, edema, and inflammation. Toxin B is a cytotoxin that causes\nmucosal injury and further activation of the inflammatory cascade.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The clinical presentation of\nCDI ranges from self-limited diarrhea to severe colitis complicated by toxic\nmegacolon or colonic perforation. The classic presentation is cramping\nabdominal pain with profuse, mucoid, malodorous, watery stools. Fever,\nabdominal pain, and leukocytosis are common. Oral metronidazole and oral\nvancomycin are used to treat CDI. Metronidazole, which is much less expensive\nthan vancomycin, is the drug of choice for mild-to-moderate CDI.

Ulcerative colitis is characterized by\ninflammation and ulceration confined to the colonic mucosa. Crohn&rsquo;s disease is\nmanifested by transmural inflammation and granulomas affecting any segment of\nthe GI tract, including the colon. Ulcerative colitis invariably involves the\nrectum and extends proximally without skipping segments. Crohn&rsquo;s disease causes\ndiscontinuous, patchy inflammation of the GI tract, usually involving the small\nbowel, ileum, and colon. N\n </span>\n <span>\n  ewly diagnosed IBD has its peak incidence in the second\ndecade of life, with the vast majority of new cases occurring in people aged\n15-40 years.\n </span>\n <span>\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Crohn&rsquo;s disease is an\nidiopathic, chronic, transmural inflammatory process of the bowel that often\nleads to fibrosis and obstructive symptoms and can affect any part of the\ngastrointestinal tract from the mouth to the anus. Approximately 30% of Crohn&rsquo;s\ndisease cases involve the small bowel, particularly the terminal ileum, another\n30% involve the colon alone, and 40% involve both the small bowel and colon.\nThe characteristic presentation of Crohn&rsquo;s disease is abdominal pain and\ndiarrhea, which may be complicated by intestinal fistulization, obstruction, or\nboth. Additional findings may include malnutrition and bone demineralization.\nUnpredictable flares and remissions characterize the long-term course of this\ndisease. Microscopically, focal inflammatory infiltrates form around the\ncrypts. Ulceration of the superficial mucosa occurs and crypt abscesses\ndevelop. Later, inflammatory cells invade the deep mucosal layers and form noncaseating\ngranulomas. The granulomas extend through all layers of the intestinal wall and\ninto the mesentery and regional lymph nodes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Ulcerative colitis is a\nchronic, idiopathic condition characterized by inflammation of the colon.\nPatients typically have rectal bleeding, frequent stools, and mucous discharge\nwith or without tenesmus. Acute and chronic inflammation of the lamina propria,\ncrypt branching, and villous atrophy occur. There is discharge of mucus from\ngoblet cells. Ulcers appear and are soon covered by granulation tissue.\nExcessive fibrosis is not a feature of the disease. Mucosal ulceration with\nexcessive granulation tissue results in polypoidal mucosal excrescences, called\n&ldquo;pseudopolyps.&rdquo;\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <b>\n  <span>\n   Ischemic colitis\n  </span>\n </b>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Ischemic colitis\n </span>\n is a condition caused by an inadequate blood\nsupply to the colon. It affects elderly people primarily and may be due to\natherosclerotic disease, hypotension, or blood clot. Symptoms depend on the\nseverity of ischemia. The most common symptoms are abdominal pain (often left-sided)\nand mild to moderate rectal bleeding. The pain may be out of proportion to\nabdominal tenderness. In its mildest form, mucosal and submucosal edema and\nhemorrhage occur, sometimes with mild necrosis and ulceration. With severe\nischemia, findings resembling inflammatory bowel disease (i.e. ulcerations,\ncrypt abscesses and pseudopolyps) may be present.

During ovulation, an ovum is released from the mature\nfollicle. Some women experience brief, dull, unilateral pelvic pain near the\ntime of ovulation, termed\n  <i>\n   Mittelschmerz\n  </i>\n  , which may be due to leakage of\nfollicular fluid into the abdominal cavity.

Endometrial glands in these layers\nproliferate under the influence of estrogen in the follicular phase so that the\nmucosa thickens.

</span>\n <span>\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The\n <span>\n  loop of Henle\n </span>\n is the portion of the nephron that extends from the\nproximal convoluted tubule to the distal convoluted tubule. The loop has a\nhairpin bend in the renal medulla. Its main function is to create a\nconcentration gradient in the medulla. By means of a countercurrent multiplier\nsystem using sodium pumps, an area of high sodium concentration is created in\nthe medulla. This increases the tonicity of the medulla. The hypertonic medulla\nthen passively draws water from the filtrate, concentrating the urine.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The loop of Henle consists\nof a descending and an ascending limb. The descending limb is permeable to\nwater. As the filtrate travels down the descending limb in the hypertonic\nmedulla, water flows out freely until the tonicity of the filtrate and\ninterstitium equilibrate. The thick ascending limb, by contrast, is impermeable\nto water. It actively absorbs sodium from the filtrate and delivers it to the\nmedullary interstitium, raising its tonicity. The hypertonic interstitium then\npassively draws water from the descending limb and collecting ducts.\n <span>\n  &nbsp;\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Cells in the thick ascending\nloop of Henle use the\n <span>\n  Na-K-2Cl\n  <b>\n  </b>\n  transporter\n </span>\n to reabsorb sodium. This transporter resides in the apical membrane of cells\nlining the thick ascending limb. (The apical membrane is on the luminal side).\nFor each molecule of sodium absorbed, a molecule of potassium and two molecules\nof chloride are also absorbed. Hence, the designation: Na-K-2Cl. (Na, K, and Cl\nare transported in the same direction, i.e., from the filtrate into the cell.)\n <span>\n  &nbsp;\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Furosemide (Lasix) and other\nloop diuretics inhibit the Na-K-2Cl transporter in the thick ascending limb of\nthe loop of Henle. This impairs sodium absorption, which is needed to raise the\ntonicity of the medullary interstitium. By inhibiting sodium absorption,\nfurosemide decreases the tonicity (osmolarity) of the medullary interstitium.\nTonicity drives water absorption in the descending limb of the loop. By\ndecreased the tonicity of the medullary interstitium, furosemide decreases\nwater absorption in the descending limb.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <b>\n  Answer A is correct\n </b>\n . Furosemide inhibits the Na-K-2Cl transporter\nin the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. This reduces sodium\nabsorption. Normally, sodium is absorbed and delivered to the medullary\ninterstitium, raising its osmolarity. By inhibiting sodium absorption,\nfurosemide reduces the osmolarity of the medullary interstitium. That\nosmolarity drives passive water absorption from the descending limb of the\nloop. When the osmolarity of the interstitium is reduced after administration\nof furosemide, sodium absorption in the descending limb is reduced as well.\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  A\n38-year-old man notices dark urine after running a 15-km race.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Urinalysis\nshows:\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Specific\ngravity:\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  </span>\n  1.010\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Dipstick\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Glucose:\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  </span>\n  negative\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Blood:\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  </span>\n  positive\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Nitrates:\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  </span>\n  negative\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Microscopic\nexamination\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  WBC\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  </span>\n  negative\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  RBC\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  </span>\n  negative\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Which of\nthe following is the most likely cause of these findings?\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  A.

Also important, but less well characterized, is the\n    response of the bladder muscle to the increase in outlet resistance\n    provided by the combination of mechanical obstruction and increased\n    prostatic and bladder neck smooth muscle tone. As bladder outlet resistance\n    increases, the bladder responds by increasing the force of contraction.\n    Later during the course of the obstructive process, the bladder wall\n    becomes thickened and loses compliance, which exacerbates symptoms.\n        </span>\n       </p>\n      </td>\n     </tr>\n    </table>\n    <p class=\"\">\n     <span>\n     </span>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"\">\n     <span>\n     </span>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"\">\n     <a name=\"P072006\">\n     </a>\n     <span>\n     </span>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"\">\n     <a name=\"HC072003\">\n     </a>\n     <a name=\"T072001\">\n     </a>\n     <span>\n     </span>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"\">\n     <span>\n     </span>\n    </p>\n    <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"\" width=\"85%\">\n     <tr>\n      <td width=\"100%\">\n       <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n        <b>\n         <span>\n          Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms\n         </span>\n        </b>\n       </p>\n      </td>\n     </tr>\n    </table>\n    <p class=\"\">\n     <span>\n     </span>\n    </p>\n    <div align=\"center\">\n     <table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"\" width=\"67%\">\n      <tr>\n       <td valign=\"bottom\">\n        <p class=\"\">\n         <a name=\"T072001.50\">\n         </a>\n         <b>\n          <span>\n           Irritative\n          </span>\n         </b>\n         <span>\n         </span>\n        </p>\n       </td>\n       <td valign=\"bottom\" width=\"52%\">\n        <p class=\"\">\n         <b>\n          <span>\n           Obstructive\n          </span>\n         </b>\n         <span>\n         </span>\n        </p>\n       </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n       <td valign=\"top\">\n        <p class=\"\">\n         <a name=\"T072001.100\">\n         </a>\n         <span>\n          Frequency\n         </span>\n        </p>\n       </td>\n       <td valign=\"top\" width=\"52%\">\n        <p class=\"\">\n         <span>\n          Hesitancy\n         </span>\n        </p>\n       </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n       <td valign=\"top\">\n        <p class=\"\">\n         <a name=\"T072001.150\">\n         </a>\n         <span>\n          Nocturia\n         </span>\n        </p>\n       </td>\n       <td valign=\"top\" width=\"52%\">\n        <p class=\"\">\n         <span>\n          Slow stream\n         </span>\n        </p>\n       </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n       <td valign=\"top\">\n        <p class=\"\">\n         <a name=\"T072001.200\">\n         </a>\n         <span>\n          Urgency\n         </span>\n        </p>\n       </td>\n       <td valign=\"top\" width=\"52%\">\n        <p class=\"\">\n         <span>\n          Stop-and-start voiding\n         </span>\n        </p>\n       </td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n       <td valign=\"top\">\n        <p class=\"\">\n         <a name=\"T072001.250\">\n         </a>\n         <span>\n          Urge incontinence\n         </span>\n        </p>\n       </td>\n       <td valign=\"top\" width=\"52%\">\n        <p class=\"\">\n         <span>\n          Sensation of incomplete emptying\n         </span>\n        </p>\n       </td>\n      </tr>\n     </table>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"\">\n     <span>\n     </span>\n    </p>\n    <div align=\"center\">\n     <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"\" width=\"90%\">\n      <tr>\n       <td width=\"100%\">\n       </td>\n      </tr>\n     </table>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"\">\n     <span>\n     </span>\n    </p>\n    <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"\" width=\"100%\">\n     <tr>\n      <td width=\"100%\">\n       <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n        <a name=\"F072001\">\n        </a>\n        <span>\n         <img alt=\"Description: http://www.studentconsult.com/common/showimage.cfm?mediaISBN=9781416061090&amp;FigFile=S9781416061090-072-f001.jpg&amp;size=fullsize\" border=\"0\" height=\"189\" src=\"static/img/tutorials/image342.png\" v:shapes=\"Picture_x0020_347475\" width=\"243\"/>\n        </span>\n        <span>\n        </span>\n       </p>\n      </td>\n     </tr>\n     <tr>\n      <td width=\"100%\">\n      </td>\n     </tr>\n    </table>\n    <p class=\"\">\n     <span>\n     </span>\n    </p>\n    <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"\" width=\"100%\">\n     <tr>\n      <td width=\"100%\">\n       <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n        <a name=\"P072008\">\n        </a>\n        <span>\n        </span>\n       </p>\n       <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n        <span>\n         Causes of lower urinary tract symptoms.

The bladder neck and prostate are richly innervated with\n    &alpha;-adrenergic receptors, specifically &alpha;\n         <sub>\n          1a\n         </sub>\n         receptors,\n    which constitute about 70% to 80% of the total number of &alpha; receptors\n    in these areas. &alpha;\n         <sub>\n          1b\n         </sub>\n         receptors modulate vascular smooth\n    muscle contraction and are located in the bladder neck and prostate to a\n    lesser degree. Doxazosin, terazosin, tamsulosin, and extended-release\n    alfuzosin are long acting &alpha;-receptor antagonists. They are generally\n    administered once daily, usually at bedtime to minimize the potential for\n    orthostatic hypotension. These medications act through &alpha;\n         <sub>\n          1\n         </sub>\n         receptors and can cause vasodilation resulting in transient hypotension and\n    light-headedness. Tamsulosin is a selective &alpha;\n         <sub>\n          1a\n         </sub>\n         receptor\n    antagonist with a long half-life.

These conjugates are recognized as foreign\nbodies by Langerhans cells, which internalize the protein; transport it through\nthe lymphatic system to regional lymph nodes; and present it to T-lymphocytes.\nThis process is controlled by cytokines and chemokines. As the Langerhans cells\nare transported to the lymph nodes, they differentiate into dendritic cells,\nwhich are immunostimulatory.

The term &ldquo;Cushing disease&rdquo; is reserved for Cushing syndrome\nthat is caused by excessive secretion of adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) by\na pituitary tumor, usually an adenoma.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Cushing\ndisease is responsible for roughly two-thirds of the cases of endogenous\nCushing syndrome. The remaining endogenous cases are caused by ectopic\nACTH-secreting tumors and primary adrenal neoplasms. Cushing disease occurs\nmost frequently in women of reproductive age, but it can affect males and\nfemales of any age.The pituitary tumors in Cushing disease are usually\nmicroadenomas, which, by definition, are 10 mm or less in diameter.\nMicroadenomas generally do not cause symptoms by local mass effect. These\ntumors are most often discovered when clinical manifestations of\nhypercortisolism resulting from hypersecretion of ACTH prompt an appropriate\ndiagnostic work-up. Occasionally, microadenomas are found incidentally during\nimaging performed for other reasons. Macroadenomas are uncommon in patients\nwith Cushing disease. These tumors cause mass effect when their size exceeds 15\nmm in diameter. Suprasellar extension and optic chiasm compression, local bone\nerosion, cavernous sinus compression, and panhypopituitarism may occur as a\nmacroadenoma enlarges.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Although\npituitary adenomas causing Cushing disease secrete excessive amounts of ACTH,\nthey generally retain some negative feedback responsiveness to high doses of\nglucocorticoids. Ectopic sources of ACTH, usually in the form of extracranial\nneoplasms, however, are generally not responsive to negative feedback with high\ndoses of glucocorticoids. A common effect of elevated ACTH levels (whatever the\nsource) is bilateral adrenocortical hyperplasia.\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  When\nCushing syndrome is suspected, initial laboratory testing is usually directed\nat confirming excessive glucocorticoid production. This is best accomplished\nthrough analysis of a 24-hour urine collection for urinary free cortisol\nexcretion. Values greater than 300 &mu;g/day are considered diagnostic for\nCushing syndrome.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Once\nhypersecretion of cortisol is confirmed, the next step is to determine whether\nthe pathologic state is ACTH-dependent or ACTH-independent. This can be\naccomplished through measurement of the late-afternoon ACTH level.\n(Late-afternoon (after 4 p.m.) timing is important because ACTH levels are\nnormally low at that time.) If the plasma ACTH level is &gt; 10 pg/mL, then the\nprocess is ACTH-dependent. If the ACTH level is &lt; 5 pg/mL, then the process\nis ACTH-independent.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  If the\nprocess is ACTH-dependent, a high-dose dexamethasone suppression test combined\nwith cranial MRI studies may aid in localizing the site of ACTH overproduction.\nIn an 8-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test, a single 8-mg dose of\ndexamethasone is given at 11 p.m., and the serum cortisol level is measured at\n8 a.m. the next morning. Suppression of the cortisol level to less than 50% of\nbaseline is considered indicative of Cushing disease (pituitary microadenoma).\nFailure of dexamethasone to suppress cortisol levels to less than 50% of\nbaseline suggests an ectopic source of ACTH production (e.g. extracranial\nneoplasm).\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  The\npatient in this vignette has signs of Cushing syndrome: moon face,\nsupraclavicular fat pads, violaceous striae, hypertension, weight gain, and\nosteopenia. A high urinary free cortisol level confirms the diagnosis of\nCushing syndrome. The high ACTH level indicates that the disorder is\nACTH-dependent. A positive high-dose dexamethasone test (suppression of serum\ncortisol to &lt; 50% baseline) indicates that the patient most likely has\nCushing disease (a pituitary microadenoma secreting ACTH).\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  </span>\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Excessive\nACTH production stimulates the adrenal glands to produce excessive cortisol.\nFree cortisol passes easily through cellular membranes, where it binds to the\nglucocorticoid receptor. The glucocorticoid receptor is expressed in almost\nevery cell in the body and regulates genes controlling the development,\nmetabolism, and immune response. Aldosterone, which is regulated mainly through\nthe renin-angiotensin system, also passes easily through cellular membranes. It\nacts on mineralocorticoid receptors within the cells of the distal tubule and\nthe collecting duct of the kidney nephron. This activates the basolateral Na\n  <sup>\n   +\n  </sup>\n  /K\n  <sup>\n   +\n  </sup>\n  pumps, which pump three sodium ions out of the cell and two potassium ions into\nthe cell. This results in reabsorption of sodium (Na\n  <sup>\n   +\n  </sup>\n  ) ions and\nwater (which follows sodium) into the blood, and secreting potassium (K\n  <sup>\n   +\n  </sup>\n  )\nions into the urine (lumen of collecting duct).\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  The\nmineralocorticoid receptor is activated by mineralocorticoids, such as\naldosterone and deoxycorticosterone, as well as glucocorticoids, such as\ncortisol. Normally, the mineralocorticoid receptor is &ldquo;protected&rdquo; from\nglucocorticoids by co-localization of an enzyme, 11&szlig;-hydroxysteroid\ndehydrogenase type 2 (11&szlig;-HSD2), which converts cortisol to inactive cortisone.\nIn states of excess cortisol (Cushing syndrome), the enzymatic activity can be\noverwhelmed such that bound cortisol is not metabolized and there is activation\nof the mineralcorticoid receptor.

In states of\nexcess cortisol, the enzymatic activity of 11&beta;-hydroxysteroid\ndehydrogenase 2 can be overwhelmed such that bound cortisol is not metabolized\nand there is activation of the mineralcorticoid receptor. Thus, cortisol will\nhave mineralcorticoid activity under this circumstance. The mineralocorticoid\nactivity causes a rise in blood pressure (due to the absorption of sodium and\nwater from tubules) and a drop in serum potassium levels.

Insulin resistance precedes the\nonset of diabetes, possibly by many decades. About 30% of Americans have\ninsulin resistance. This is defined as a decrease in the efficacy of insulin\n(usually determined as removal of glucose from the peripheral blood) at any\ngiven insulin level. Most people with insulin resistance do\n  <i>\n   not\n  </i>\n  have type 2 diabetes mellitus\nbecause their pancreas is able to compensate for the resistance by producing\nmore insulin. In people who develop diabetes, however, the &beta; cells begin\nto fail and insulin production declines. At the onset of type 2 diabetes\nmellitus, about 50% of maximal insulin production is lost. At this stage,\npatients may be treated of oral medicines, such as glipizide (which stimulates\n&beta; cells to produce insulin) or metformin (which decreases insulin\nresistance). Oral medicines may control blood sugar levels for years until\ninsulin secretion declines further.

Acetoacetate is spontaneously\n(non-enzymatically) decarboxylated to form acetone. Acetone is volatile and\nreleased from the lungs, giving a sweet smell to the breath. Being acidic, the\nketones lower the pH of the blood producing a metabolic acidosis.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Glucose levels rise\nbecause of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis in

While nerve impulse profiles are, for the most part, always the\nsame, skeletal muscles are able to produce varying levels of contractile force.\nThis phenomenon is explained by &ldquo;\n  <i>\n   force\nsummation\n  </i>\n  .&rdquo; Force summation is the addition of individual twitch\ncontractions to increase the intensity of overall muscle contraction. It is\nachieved in two ways: by increasing the number and size of contractile units\nsimultaneously, called\n  <i>\n   recruitment of motor units\n  </i>\n  <span>\n   ,\n  </span>\n  and by increasing the frequency at which action potentials are\nsent to muscle fibers, called\n  <i>\n   temporal\n   <span>\n    summation\n   </span>\n  </i>\n  .\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Recruitment of motor units:\n </span>\n <span>\n  A motor unit includes the motor neuron plus all\nof the muscle fibers it innervates. The degree of contraction of a skeletal\nmuscle is influenced by the number of motor units being stimulated. Skeletal\nmuscles consist of numerous motor units and, therefore, stimulating more motor\nunits creates a stronger contraction.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Temporal summation:\n </span>\n An increase in the frequency with which a\nmuscle is stimulated increases the strength of contraction. With rapid\nstimulation (so rapid that a muscle does not completely relax between\nsuccessive stimulations), a muscle fiber is re-stimulated while there is still\nsome contractile activity. As a result, there is a &ldquo;summation&rdquo; of the\ncontractile force. In addition, with rapid stimulation there isn&rsquo;t enough time\nbetween successive stimulations to remove all the calcium from the sarcoplasm.\nSo with several stimulations in rapid succession, calcium levels in the\nsarcoplasm increase. More calcium means more active cross-bridges and,\ntherefore, a stronger contraction. (If a muscle fiber is stimulated so rapidly\nthat it does not relax at all between stimuli, a smooth, sustained contraction\ncalled\n <span>\n  tetanus\n </span>\n occurs.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Skeletal muscles contract\naccording to the\n <i>\n  sliding filament model\n </i>\n <span>\n  (Figure 1).\n </span>\n</p>\n", "choices": ["<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   A.\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Amplitude\nof action potentials of single motor neurons\n </span>\n</p>\n", "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   B.\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Duration\nof action potentials in single motor neurons\n </span>\n</p>\n", "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   C.\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Frequency\nof firing of individual motor neurons\n </span>\n</p>\n", "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   D.\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Number\nof active end-plates on the muscle fiber\n </span>\n</p>\n", "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   E.\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Rate\nof synthesis of acetylcholine at the motor nerve terminal\n </span>\n</p>\n"]}, {"question": "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Figure 1\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <img alt=\"Description: Muskel-molekulartranslation\" border=\"0\" height=\"596\" src=\"static/img/tutorials/image386.png\" v:shapes=\"Picture_x0020_347298\" width=\"304\"/>\n </span>\n <span>\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Figure 2\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Sarcomere.svg\">\n  <span>\n   <img alt=\"Description: File:Sarcomere.svg\" border=\"0\" height=\"290\" src=\"static/img/tutorials/image388.png\" v:shapes=\"Picture_x0020_347297\" width=\"373\"/>\n  </span>\n </a>\n <span>\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <b>\n  <span>\n   Answer C is correct.\n  </span>\n </b>\n <span>\n  The force of muscle\ncontraction is increased by two mechanisms: recruitment of more motor units and\ntemporal summation (firing of individual motor neurons more frequently).\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <b>\n  <span>\n   Answer A is incorrect\n  </span>\n </b>\n <span>\n  .

In the\npreclinical and early stages of the disease, the serum level of creatine kinase\nis grossly elevated (50 to 100 times the upper limit of normal) because of its\nrelease from diseased muscle.

It is reported to occur in one in 3500\nlive births. There is a family history in 70% of patients, and the condition\noccurs as a spontaneous mutation in about 30% of patients. The disorder is the\nresult of a mutation in a region of the X chromosome that encodes the 400-kd\nprotein dystrophin. Dystrophin is important to the stability of the cell\nmembrane cytoskeleton. In patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the total\nabsence of this protein results in progressive muscle degeneration and loss of\nfunction.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Children with Duchenne\nmuscular dystrophy usually reach early motor milestones at appropriate times,\nbut independent ambulation may be delayed, and many are initially toe-walkers.\nThe disease usually becomes evident between 3 and 6 years of age. Clinical features\ninclude large, firm calf muscles; the tendency to toe-walking; a widely based\nstance; and a waddling gait. The diagnosis is usually obvious by the time the\nchild is 5 or 6 years old. A dramatically elevated level of creatine kinase (50\nto 100 times normal) and DNA analysis of blood samples confirm the diagnosis.\nMuscle biopsy shows variations in fiber size, internal nuclei, split fibers,\ndegenerating or regenerating fibers, and fibrofatty tissue deposition.\nDystrophin testing of the muscle biopsy specimen confirms the type of muscular\ndystrophy\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The degree of muscular\nweakness depends on the age of the patient.

Patients with classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency have\n    various degrees of mineralocorticoid deficiency (salt-losing form) and\n    virilization. The most useful measurement for the diagnosis of classic\n    21-hydroxylase deficiency is that of plasma 17-hydroxyprogesterone. A value\n    greater than 200 ng/dL is consistent with the diagnosis.

This diagnosis should be considered in women with\n    unexplained hirsutism and menstrual abnormalities or infertility. The aim\n    of treatment for classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency is to replace\n    glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids, suppress ACTH and androgen\n    overproduction, and allow for normal growth and sexual maturation in\n    children.\n         <span>\n         </span>\n        </span>\n       </p>\n       <p class=\"\">\n        <span>\n        </span>\n       </p>\n       <a name=\"P067023\">\n       </a>\n      </td>\n     </tr>\n    </table>\n    <p class=\"\">\n     <span>\n     </span>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"\">\n     <a name=\"P067022\">\n     </a>\n     <span>\n     </span>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"\">\n     <a name=\"P067024\">\n     </a>\n     <span>\n     </span>\n    </p>\n    <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"\" width=\"100%\">\n     <tr>\n      <td width=\"100%\">\n       <p class=\"\">\n        <a name=\"P067025\">\n        </a>\n        <span>\n         11&beta;-Hydroxylase (CYP11B1) deficiency accounts for about\n    5% of the patients with CAH.

HHM accounts for about 80% of\n    patients with malignancy-associated hypercalcemia (MAHC) and is the result\n    of secretion by tumors of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP).\n    PTHrP mimics the actions of parathyroid hormone (PTH) on the kidney to\n    prevent calcium excretion and on the skeleton to activate osteoclasts and\n    induce bone resorption.

These observations, together with histologic evidence for\n    aggressive bone resorption at sites within the skeleton not involved by\n    tumor, make clear that HHM is indeed the result of a tumor-derived&nbsp;\n        <i>\n         humor\n        </i>\n        &nbsp;or\n    hormone.

However,\nindividuals with type O blood group can produce IgG antibodies that cross the\nplacenta and cause hemolysis. &ldquo;E&rdquo; is the correct answer because the mother in\n&ldquo;E&rdquo; has type O blood group.

The ABO antigens were the first alloantigen system to be defined\nin mammals.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n All normal individuals\nsynthesize the O antigen, which is attached to plasma membrane proteins. Most\nindividuals possess a fucosyltransferase that adds a fucose moiety to the O\nantigen, resulting in an H antigen. A single gene on chromosome 9 encodes a\nglycosyltransferase enzyme, which further modifies the H antigen. There are\nthree allelic variants of this gene. The O allele gene product is devoid of\nenzymatic activity. The A allele-encoded enzyme transfers a terminal\n <span>\n  N\n </span>\n -acetylgalactosamine moiety, and the\nB allele gene product transfers a terminal galactose moiety.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Individuals who are\nhomozygous for the O allele cannot attach terminal sugars to the H antigen and\nexpress only the H antigen. In contrast, individuals who possess an A allele\n(AA homozygotes, AO heterozygotes, or AB heterozygotes) form the A antigen by\nadding terminal\n <span>\n  N\n </span>\n -acetylgalactosamine\nto some of their H antigens. Similarly, individuals who express a B allele (BB\nhomozygotes, BO heterozygotes, or AB heterozygotes) form the B antigen by\nadding terminal galactose to some of their H antigens. AB heterozygotes form\nboth A and B antigens from some of their H antigens. The terminology has been\nsimplified so that OO individuals are said to be blood type O; AA and AO\nindividuals are blood type A; BB and BO individuals are blood type B; and AB\nindividuals are blood type AB.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Individuals who express a particular ABO\nantigen are tolerant to that antigen, but individuals who do not express that\nantigen produce natural antibodies that recognize the antigen.\n </span>\n Individuals who express A or B antigens are tolerant to these molecules and do\nnot produce anti-A or anti-B antibodies, respectively. However, bacteria\npresent in the GI tract contain antigens similar to the A and B blood group\nantigens, therefore blood group O and A individuals produce anti-B IgM\nantibodies, and blood group O and B individuals produce anti-A IgM antibodies.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  In clinical transfusion, the choice of blood\ndonors for a particular recipient is based on the expression of blood group\nantigens and the antibody responses to them.\n </span>\n If a patient receives a\ntransfusion of red blood cells from a donor who expresses the antigen not\nexpressed on self red blood cells, a transfusion reaction may result. It\nfollows that AB individuals can tolerate transfusions from all potential donors\nand are therefore called universal recipients; similarly, O individuals can\ntolerate transfusions only from O donors but can provide blood to all\nrecipients and are therefore called universal donors. In general, differences\nin\n <i>\n  minor\n </i>\n blood groups lead to red\ncell lysis only after repeated transfusions trigger a secondary antibody\nresponse.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n ABO antigens are expressed\non many other cell types in addition to blood cells, including endothelial\ncells. For this reason, ABO typing is critical to avoid hyperacute rejection of\ncertain solid organ allografts. ABO incompatibility between mother and fetus\ngenerally does not cause problems for the fetus because most of the\nanti-carbohydrate antibodies are IgM and do not cross the placenta. Individuals\nwith blood group O, however, can produce IgG antibodies against A and B\nantigens, which can cross the placenta and can cause intrauterine hemolysis in\nthe fetus, although clinically significant hemolysis related to ABO\nincompatibility is rare.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The\n <b>\n  Rhesus (Rh) antigens\n </b>\n , named after the monkey species in which they\nwere originally identified, are another clinically important group of blood\ngroup antigens. Rh proteins are encoded by two tightly linked genes, but only\none of them, called RhD, is commonly considered in clinical blood typing. This\nis because up to 15% of the population has an alteration of the RhD allele.\nThese people, called Rh negative, are not tolerant to the RhD antigen and will\nmake antibodies to the antigen if they are exposed to Rh-positive blood cells.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The major clinical\nsignificance of anti-Rh antibodies is related to hemolytic reactions associated\nwith pregnancy that are similar to transfusion reactions. Rh-negative mothers\ncarrying an Rh-positive fetus can be sensitized by fetal red blood cells that\nenter the maternal circulation, usually during childbirth. Since the Rh antigen\nis a protein, as opposed to the carbohydrate ABO antigens, class-switched IgG\nantibodies are generated in Rh-negative mothers. Subsequent pregnancies in\nwhich the fetus is Rh positive are at risk because the maternal anti-Rh IgG\nantibodies can cross the placenta and mediate the destruction of the fetal red\nblood cells.

The treatment prevents the baby's Rh-positive red blood cells that\nentered the mother's circulation from inducing the production of anti-Rh\nantibodies in the mother.

Any condition that causes the quantity of oxygen transported to the\ntissues to decrease ordinarily increases the rate of red blood cell production.\nThus, when a person becomes extremely anemic as a result of hemorrhage, for example,\nthe bone marrow immediately begins to produce large quantities of red blood\ncells.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  The principal factor that stimulates red\nblood cell production is a circulating hormone called\n  <b>\n   erythropoietin\n  </b>\n  (a glycoprotein). In the absence of erythropoietin,\nhypoxia has either no effect or very little effect in stimulating red blood\ncell production.

People of African, Middle Eastern,\nSouth Asian, and Mediterranean descent are predominantly affected. G6PD\ndeficiency is an X-linked disorder characterized by abnormally low levels of\nglucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, an enzyme involved in the pentose phosphate\npathway, which is especially important in red blood cell metabolism.\nIndividuals with the disease exhibit nonimmune hemolytic anemia in response to\na number of causes, most commonly infection or exposure to certain medications\nor chemicals.

(The name is derived from the Italian name for broad bean:\n <i>\n  fava\n </i>\n ).\nMost individuals with G6PD deficiency are asymptomatic. Symptomatic patients\nare usually male (due to an X-linked pattern of inheritance), but female\ncarriers can be clinically affected due to unfavorable Lyonization, where\nrandom inactivation of an X-chromosome in certain cells creates a population of\nG6PD-deficient red blood cells coexisting with normal red cells.\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Many\nsubstances are potentially harmful to people with G6PD deficiency. Certain\nantimalarial drugs (e.g. primaquine, pamaquine and chloroquine) can cause\nhemolysis in people with G6PD deficiency. Sulfonamides (e.g. sulfamethoxazole),\nmethylene blue, and naphthalene should also be avoided by people with G6PD\ndeficiency, as should certain analgesics (e.g. aspirin) and a few non-sulfa\nantibiotics (nalidixic acid, nitrofurantoin, isoniazid, and dapsone). Glucose-6-phosphate\ndehydrogenase is an enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway. It converts\nglucose-6-phosphate to 6-phosphoglucono-&delta;-lactone, and it is the\nrate-limiting enzyme in this pathway. The pentose phosphate pathway supplies\nreducing equivalents to cells by maintaining the level of nicotinamide adenine\ndinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). NADPH, in turn, maintains the supply of reduced\nglutathione, which is used to mop up free radicals that cause oxidative damage.\nThe G6PD / NADPH pathway is the\n  <i>\n   only\n  </i>\n  source of biochemical reductant\nneeded to maintain reduced glutathione in red blood cells.

Oxidative stress\ncan result from infection, chemical exposure, medication, or certain foods.\nWhen reduced glutathione is consumed, enzymes and other proteins (including\nhemoglobin) are damaged by oxidants. Damaged red cells are phagocytosed and\nsequestered in the spleen; the hemoglobin is metabolized to bilirubin, which\nmay cause jaundice at high concentrations.\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  The\ndiagnosis should be suspected when patients from certain ethnic groups (e.g.,\npeople of Mediterranean descent) develop hemolysis after an oxidative\nchallenge, especially when there is a positive family history.

It affects B cell lymphocytes,\nwhich originate in the bone marrow, develop in lymph nodes, and normally fight\ninfection by producing antibodies. In CLL, the DNA of a B cell is damaged, so\nthat it cannot produce antibodies; patients are often immunocompromised as a\nresult. B cells grow out of control and accumulate in the bone marrow and\nblood, where they crowd out healthy blood cells. CLL usually presents in\nadults; most newly diagnosed patients are over the age of 50. Affected\nindividuals are often symptomatic. The clue to the diagnosis may be an abnormal\nblood test; patients typically have a high white blood cell count with a\npreponderance of mature lymphocytes. As CLL progresses, lymphadenopathy,\nsplenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and eventually anemia and infections occur. Early\nCLL is typically not treated; late CLL is treated with chemotherapy and other\nmodalities. Molecular\n <span>\n  &nbsp;\n </span>\n analysis has\ndistinguished two major types of CLL with different survival times. CLL lacking\nsomatic hypermutation of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene is usually\npositive for the marker ZAP-70 has an average survival of 5 years. CLL with\nsomatic hypermutation of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene is negative for\nZAP-70 and has an average survival of more than 25 years. Many patients,\nespecially older ones, with slowly progressing disease can be reassured that\nthey may not need any treatment in their lifetime.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <b>\n  Chronic myelogenous\nleukemia\n </b>\n <b>\n  (\n  <span>\n   CML\n  </span>\n  )\n </b>\n is a form of leukemia characterized by the increased and\nunregulated growth of predominantly myeloid cells in the bone marrow and the\naccumulation of these cells in the blood. CML is a clonal bone marrow stem cell\ndisorder in which proliferation of mature granulocytes (neutrophils,\neosinophils, and basophils) and their precursors is the main finding. It is a\ntype of myeloproliferative neoplasm associated with a characteristic\nchromosomal translocation called the Philadelphia chromosome. Patients are\noften asymptomatic at diagnosis, presenting incidentally with an elevated white\nblood cell count on a routine laboratory test. Symptoms of CML may include\nleft-sided abdominal pain due to an enlarged spleen, malaise, joint or hip\npain, anemia, and thrombocytopenia with easy bruising (although an\n <i>\n  increased\n </i>\n platelet count may also occur). CML is often suspected on the basis of an\nabnormal blood count, which shows increased granulocytes of all types,\ntypically including mature myeloid cells. Basophils and eosinophils are almost\nalways increased. A bone marrow biopsy is performed as part of the evaluation.\nCML is diagnosed by detecting the Philadelphia chromosome. The\n <span>\n  Philadelphia chromosome\n </span>\n is specific\nfor CML. It is the result of a reciprocal translocation between chromosome 9\nand 22. The genes involved are\n <i>\n  abl1\n </i>\n (Abelson protoncogene) on chromosome 9, a tyrosine kinase, and\n <i>\n  bcr\n </i>\n (breakpoint cluster region) on\nchromosome 22; the resulting fusion gene leads to dysregulation of the abl\ntyrosine kinase. CML is now largely treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors\n(TKIs) such as imatinib mesylate (Gleevec), which have led to dramatically\nimproved survival rates.\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n <span>\n  <img alt=\"Description: philadelphia_chromosome\" border=\"0\" height=\"186\" src=\"static/img/tutorials/image444.png\" v:shapes=\"Picture_x0020_347350\" width=\"240\"/>\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <b>\n  <span>\n   Acute\nlymphoblastic leukemia\n  </span>\n </b>\n <b>\n  <span>\n   (\n   <span>\n    ALL\n   </span>\n   )\n  </span>\n </b>\n <span>\n  is a form of leukemia characterized by\nexcess lymphoblasts.

The overall cure rate in\nchildren is about 80%. &ldquo;\n  <span>\n   Acute&rdquo;\n  </span>\n  refers to the relatively short time course of the disease, being fatal in as\nlittle as a few weeks if untreated. Findings may include fatigue, anemia,\nweight loss, loss of appetite, excessive bruising, bone pain, joint pain,\nbreathlessness, enlarged lymph nodes, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and petechiae\n(due to thrombocytopenia).\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;\n  </span>\n  Symptoms\nare so general that many other diseases must be considered in the differential\ndiagnosis. Typically, the higher the white blood cell count, the worse the\nprognosis. Blast cells are seen on blood smears in majority of cases.\nDefinitive diagnosis is made by flow cytometry on peripheral blood or bone\nmarrow. Important prognostic factors include age, WBC count and cytogenetic\nanalysis. The majority of cases are composed of immature B lineage cells (B\nlymphoblastic leukemia or precursor B-cell ALL); a minority are composed of\nimmature T lineage cells (T lymphoblastic or precursor T-cell ALL). Treatment\nis prolonged (2.5 to 3 years) and includes a long maintenance phase. Central\nnervous system relapse is common if prophylactic treatment is not used.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <b>\n  Acute myeloid leukemia\n </b>\n is a cancer of the myeloid line of blood cells, characterized by the rapid\ngrowth of immature myeloid cells that accumulate in the bone marrow and\ninterfere with the production of normal mature blood cells. AML is the most\ncommon acute leukemia affecting adults. Symptoms are caused by replacement of\nnormal bone marrow with leukemic cells, which causes a drop in red blood cells,\nplatelets, and normal white blood cells. These symptoms include fatigue,\nshortness of breath, easy bruising and bleeding, bone pain, joint pain, and\nincreased risk of infection. As an acute leukemia, AML progresses rapidly and\nis typically fatal within weeks or months if untreated. Enlargement of the\nspleen may occur but is usually mild and asymptomatic. Lymph node swelling is\nrare, in contrast to acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The first clue to a\ndiagnosis of AML is typically an abnormal blood count.\n <span>\n  &nbsp;\n </span>\n While an excess of abnormal white blood\ncells (leukocytosis) is a common finding, and leukemic blasts are sometimes\nseen, AML can also present with\n <i>\n  low\n </i>\n white blood cell count. Definitive\ndiagnosis usually requires an adequate bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. Auer\nrods, which are specific for AML, may be seen. Auer rods are clumps of\nazurophilic granular material that form elongated needles seen in the cytoplasm\nof leukemic blasts. Important prognostic factors include age, results of\ncytogenetic analysis, and more recently the presence of specific genetic\nmutations.\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n <span>\n  <img alt=\"Description: stains1\" border=\"0\" height=\"204\" src=\"static/img/tutorials/image446.png\" v:shapes=\"Picture_x0020_347349\" width=\"293\"/>\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/Myeloblast_with_Auer_rod_smear_2010-01-27.JPG\">\n  <span>\n   <img alt=\"Description: Description: File:Myeloblast with Auer rod smear 2010-01-27.JPG\" border=\"0\" height=\"265\" src=\"static/img/tutorials/image448.png\" v:shapes=\"Picture_x0020_347348\" width=\"353\"/>\n  </span>\n </a>\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n Auer\nrods in a patient with AML\n</p>\n", "choices": ["<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   A.\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Acute lymphoblastic leukemia\n </span>\n <span>\n </span>\n</p>\n", "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   B.\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Acute myeloid leukemia\n </span>\n <span>\n </span>\n</p>\n", "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   C.\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Chronic\n  <span>\n   lymphoid leukemia\n  </span>\n </span>\n</p>\n", "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   D.\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Chronic myelogenous leukemia\n </span>\n <span>\n </span>\n</p>\n"]}, {"question": "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  A\n52-year-old woman has adenocarcinoma of the left breast.

The ABI is calculated by dividing the systolic blood pressure at the\nankle by the systolic blood pressures in the arm. When the systolic blood\npressure in the ankle is lower than the pressure in the arm, PAD is suspected.\nA normal ABI is 1.0-1.2. An ABI less than 0.9 is consistent with PAD; values\nbelow 0.5 indicate severe PAD. If the ABI is abnormal, the next step is usually\na Doppler ultrasound examination to determine the location and extent of\natherosclerosis.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n People with PAD have a\n4-to-5-fold greater risk of having a myocardial infarction or stroke. If\nsevere, PAD can lead to gangrene and amputation of the leg or foot. Major risk\nfactors for PAD include smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Complications\nof PAD include thromboembolism. Rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque can\ntrigger clot formation, and the newly formed thrombus can further narrow the\nartery, block the artery, or embolize distally.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Management of PAD includes\nthe following:\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   &middot;\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Risk factor management\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   o\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Smoking\ncessation\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   o\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Diabetes\nmanagement\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   o\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Hypertension\nmanagement\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   o\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Lipid\nmanagement\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   &middot;\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Antiplatelet drugs\n(i.e., aspirin, clopidogrel)\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   &middot;\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Exercise: Regular\nexercise improves walking\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   &middot;\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Medicine: Cilostazol may\nimprove symptoms of claudication\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   &middot;\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Revascularization:\nreserved for severe cases\n </span>\n</p>\n", "choices": ["<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   A.\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Arteries\n </span>\n</p>\n", "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   B.\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Arterioles\n </span>\n</p>\n", "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   C.\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Capillaries\n </span>\n</p>\n", "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   D.\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Venules\n </span>\n</p>\n", "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   E.\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Veins\n </span>\n</p>\n"]}, {"question": "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Match each\nof the following clinical scenarios with the corresponding peripheral blood\nsmear.\n </span>\n</p>\n", "answers": ["<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Answers.\n </span>\n</p>\n", "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   A.\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  10.\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;\n  </span>\n  Multiple myeloma is associated with\nRouleaux (red blood cells stacked like coins.)\n </span>\n</p>\n", "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   B.\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  9.\nSchistocytes are broken red blood cells that occur in microangiopathic\nhemolytic anemia, such as thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura.\n </span>\n</p>\n", "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   C.\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  8.\nTeardrop cells occur\n  <span>\n   in marrow disorders (e.g.,\nmyelofibrosis) associated with extramedullary hematopoiesis.\n  </span>\n </span>\n</p>\n", "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   D.\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  7.\nSpherocytes occur in patients with hereditary spherocytosis.

Early recognition and treatment of PV are important because\n    untreated patients with PV suffer significant morbidity and mortality from\n    thromboembolic disease in the cerebral, coronary, and mesenteric\n    circulations. Twenty percent of patients show symptoms of arterial and\n    venous thrombosis, and thrombosis remains the most common cause of death.\n    Typically, patients complain of headache, visual problems, mental clouding,\n    and pruritus after bathing. Occlusive vascular events such as stroke,\n    transient ischemic attacks, myocardial ischemia, and digital pain, paresthesias,\n    or gangrene are common. In addition, pulmonary, deep vein, hepatic, and\n    portal vein thromboses may occur. Paradoxically, patients are also\n    predisposed to hemorrhagic events, which are presumably caused by abnormal\n    platelet function, and such patients may exhibit gastrointestinal bleeding.\n    Physical examination often shows retinal vein occlusion, ruddy cyanosis,\n    and splenomegaly.\n       </span>\n      </p>\n     </td>\n    </tr>\n   </table>\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n    </span>\n   </p>\n   <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"\" width=\"100%\">\n    <tr>\n     <td width=\"100%\">\n      <p class=\"\">\n       <a name=\"P048011\">\n       </a>\n       <span>\n        <span>\n         &nbsp;\n        </span>\n       </span>\n      </p>\n      <p class=\"\">\n       <span>\n        Peripheral blood often appears microcytic, with or without\n    iron deficiency.

This increases\n    overall dead space ventilation, which leads to an inefficient excretion of\n    partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood (Pa\n        <span>\n         co\n        </span>\n        <sub>\n         2\n        </sub>\n        ).

However, more often than not, the presentation is subtle,\n    and the diagnosis might be difficult to make without a high level of\n    suspicion, particularly in young individuals with otherwise healthy lungs.\n    Dyspnea on exertion and atypical chest pain might be the only symptoms on\n    initial presentation. Therefore, a careful history is paramount when\n    evaluating patients for thromboembolic disease, especially those at high\n    risk for this disorder as a result of stasis, malignancy, and previous\n    history of venous thrombosis as well as other risk factors. The physical\n    examination might reveal abnormalities in lung auscultation ranging from\n    isolated crackles to diffuse wheezing. Pleural effusions might be\n    underlying areas of dullness to percussion during the physical examination.\n    Edema of the extremities, especially if the edema is asymmetrical, might\n    point to venous thrombosis. In deep vein thrombosis, dorsiflexion of the\n    foot may cause calf pain as a result of stretching the calf muscles and\n    deep veins (Homan sign). Signs of pulmonary hypertension and right\n    ventricular strain, such as increased pulmonary component of the second\n    heart sound or right ventricular heave, are not usually appreciated unless\n    there is a massive pulmonary embolus or preexisting heart or lung disease.\n       </span>\n      </p>\n     </td>\n    </tr>\n   </table>\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n    </span>\n   </p>\n   <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"\" width=\"100%\">\n    <tr>\n     <td width=\"100%\">\n      <p class=\"\">\n       <a name=\"HC019003\">\n       </a>\n       <span>\n        EVALUATION\n       </span>\n       <span>\n       </span>\n      </p>\n     </td>\n    </tr>\n   </table>\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n    </span>\n   </p>\n   <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"\" width=\"100%\">\n    <tr>\n     <td width=\"100%\">\n      <p class=\"\">\n       <a name=\"P019010\">\n       </a>\n       <span>\n        In severe cases, arterial blood\n    gas measurement may show acidemia, hypoxemia, and hypercapnia, but subtle\n    changes such as mild alkalosis might be the only abnormalities.

Specifically, there is an\nadenine-to-thymidine substitution in codon 6 of the &beta;-globin gene, which\nresults in replacement of glutamic acid by valine. This change results in an\nabnormal type of hemoglobin, hemoglobin S (HbS), which polymerizes when\ndeoxygenated. This causes red blood cell sickling. The term\n  <i>\n   sickle cell\n  </i>\n  <i>\n   anemia\n  </i>\n  refers to patients who are homozygous for the sickle-cell\nmutation (HbSS). Sickle cell anemia is, therefore, one of many types of\nsickle-cell disease, all of which are characterized by varying degrees of red\nblood cell sickling, hemolytic anemia, vasculopathy, vaso-occlusion, acute and\nchronic organ damage, and reduced lifespan.

It can also be caused by drugs with\nanticholinergic properties (e.g., tricyclic anti-depressants).\n </span>\n</p>\n", "choices": ["<p>\n <span class=\"contentmain1\">\n  <span lang=\"EN-GB\">\n   <span>\n    A.\n    <span>\n     &nbsp;&nbsp;\n    </span>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span class=\"contentmain1\">\n  <span lang=\"EN-GB\">\n   Amitriptyline\n  </span>\n </span>\n</p>\n", "<p>\n <span class=\"contentmain1\">\n  <span lang=\"EN-GB\">\n   <span>\n    B.\n    <span>\n     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n    </span>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span class=\"contentmain1\">\n  <span lang=\"EN-GB\">\n   Cimetidine\n  </span>\n </span>\n</p>\n", "<p>\n <span class=\"contentmain1\">\n  <span lang=\"EN-GB\">\n   <span>\n    C.\n    <span>\n     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n    </span>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span class=\"contentmain1\">\n  <span lang=\"EN-GB\">\n   Diazepam\n  </span>\n </span>\n</p>\n", "<p>\n <span class=\"contentmain1\">\n  <span lang=\"EN-GB\">\n   <span>\n    D.\n    <span>\n     &nbsp;&nbsp;\n    </span>\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span class=\"contentmain1\">\n  <span lang=\"EN-GB\">\n   Malathion\n  </span>\n </span>\n</p>\n", "<p>\n <span lang=\"EN-GB\">\n  <span>\n   E.\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span class=\"contentmain1\">\n  <span lang=\"EN-GB\">\n   Propranolol\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span lang=\"EN-GB\">\n </span>\n</p>\n"]}, {"question": "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  A\n59-year-old man was hospitalized after an acute myocardial infarction.

Although dementia is far more common in the geriatric\npopulation, it can occur before the age of 65, in which case it is termed\n&ldquo;early onset dementia.&rdquo;\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Dementia is a syndrome\n(i.e., set of signs and symptoms) in which affected areas of cognition may be\nmemory, attention, language, and problem solving. It is normally required to be\npresent for at least 6 months to be diagnosed. In all types of general\ncognitive dysfunction, higher mental functions are affected first in the\nprocess.Dementia reduces the ability to learn, reason, retain or recall past\nexperiences. There is also loss of patterns of thoughts, feelings and\nactivities. As dementia worsens individuals may neglect themselves and may\nbecome disinhibited or incontinent. Especially in the later stages of the\ncondition, affected persons may be disoriented in time (not knowing what day of\nthe week, day of the month, or even what year it is), in place (not knowing\nwhere they are), and in person (not knowing who they, or others around them, are).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Dementia, though often\ntreatable to some degree, is usually due to causes that are progressive and\nincurable.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Symptoms of dementia can be\nclassified as either reversible or irreversible.

They may be useful for other similar\ndiseases causing dementia such as Parkinson disease or vascular dementia.\nAcetylcholinesterase inhibitors aim to increase the amount of the\nneurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is deficient in people with dementia.\nThis is done by inhibiting the action of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, which\nbreaks down acetylcholine as part of normal brain function.

The choroid plexus consists of a layer of cuboidal epithelial cells\nsurrounding a core of capillaries and loose connective tissue. The epithelial\nlayer is continuous with the ependymal cell layer that lines the ventricles,\nbut unlike the ependyma, the choroid plexus layer has tight junctions in\nbetween cells on the side facing the ventricle (apical surface). These tight\njunctions prevent the majority of substances from crossing the cell layer into\nthe CSF; thus, the choroid plexus acts as a blood-CSF barrier. The choroid\nplexus folds into many villi around each capillary, creating frond-like\nprocesses that project into the ventricles. These villi greatly increase the\nsurface area of the choroid plexus. CSF is formed as plasma is filtered from\nthe blood through the epithelial cells. In addition to CSF production, the\nchoroid plexus acts as a filtration system, removing metabolic waste, foreign\nsubstances, and excess neurotransmitters. In this way, the choroid plexus has\nan important role in helping to maintain the delicate extracellular environment\nrequired by the brain to function optimally.\n </span>\n</p>\n", "choices": ["<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   A.\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Choroid\nplexus\n </span>\n</p>\n", "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   B.\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Dura\nmater\n </span>\n</p>\n", "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   C.\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Pia\nmater\n </span>\n</p>\n", "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <span>\n   D.\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Roof of the third\nventricle\n  <span>\n  </span>\n </span>\n</p>\n"]}, {"question": "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Normal\ninfant development involves timely acquisition of specific cognitive, social,\nand motor skills.

(Myelin is a substance that\nprovides &ldquo;electrical insulation.&rdquo; It forms a layer, the myelin sheath, which is\nusually around only the axon of a neuron. Schwann cells supply the myelin for\nperipheral neurons, whereas oligodendrocytes myelinate the axons of the central\nnervous system.) Demyelination of the optic nerve (optic neuritis) explains the\nvisual findings and demyelination of the spinal cord explains the lower\nextremity findings. The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis requires the presence\nof multiple CNS lesions, a history of relapse and remission, involvement of\nwhite matter, and exclusion of other diagnoses. The most common cause of optic\nneuritis is multiple sclerosis. Up to 50% of patients with multiple sclerosis\nwill develop optic neuritis, and in 20-30% of cases, optic neuritis is the\npresenting sign.\n </span>\n</p>\n"], "tutorial": "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  The\npathway for the pupillary light reflex begins in the retina (Figure 6-2). The\naxons from the retinal ganglion cell (RET) run through the optic nerve (ON),\noptic chiasm (CHI), and optic tract (OT). They synapse in the pretectal nucleus\n(PTN) of the midbrain at the level of the oculomotor nerve. Fibers then run\nfrom the pretectal nucleus to both Edinger-Westphal nuclei (EWN) of the\noculomotor nerve complex. The nerve fibers from the Edinger-Westphal nuclei run\nin the oculomotor nerve to the ciliary ganglion (CG) and then through short\nciliary nerves to the iris sphincter.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  When light\nis directed into one eye, the information regarding light brightness is\nsummated in the pretectal region of the midbrain.

If for some reason (e.g., optic\nnerve lesion, retinal detachment, opacified cornea), less light is &ldquo;conveyed&rdquo;\nthrough the optic nerve, the pretectal region will detect this, both\nEdinger-Westphal nuclei will receive less input, and the pupillary response\nwill be bilaterally sluggish or absent.

The efferent arc (oculomotor nerve) of the light reflex is,\ntherefore, normal. The lesion must be in the afferent limb of the reflex arc.\nFibers carrying information on light brightness cross at the optic chiasm.\nSince the patient has a uniocular deficit, the lesion must be anterior to the\noptic chiasm. This afferent pupillary defect is called the Marcus Gunn\npupillary sign.

If the dorsal columns were involved, loss of\nvibratory sensation and proprioception would be present on the ipsilateral\nside. Because the lower, but not the upper, extremities are affected, the\nlesion must be caudal to T1 and rostral to L2 (spinal levels). (The upper\nextremities are innervated by spinal nerves C5 to T1; the lower extremities are\ninnervated by spinal nerves L2 to S1.

OCD is characterized by obsessive thoughts and/or\nrepetitive compulsive actions. Obsessions are recurrent and persistent thoughts\nthat are intrusive, inappropriate, and not merely excessive worries about\nreal-life problems.

Contrary to expectation, however, treatment with tyramine has no\neffect on left pupillary size. Normally, tyramine should stimulate neuronal\nrelease of norepinephrine, causing pupillary dilation. If this is not\nhappening, the neuron must be dysfunctional. Nerves that release norepinephrine\nbelong to the sympathetic nervous system; therefore, sympathetic denervation\nwould explain the inability of the nerves to release norepinephrine in response\nto tyramine.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n In other words, epinephrine\nis effective because it stimulates the &alpha;\n <sub>\n  1\n </sub>\n adrenergic receptor\n <i>\n  directly\n </i>\n .

(ALS)\n  </b>\n  . ALS is a disease that affects upper and lower motor neurons.\nMost patients present with spasticity and hyperreflexia (upper motor neuron\nsigns) and progressive muscle weakness and atrophy (lower motor neuron signs).\nCognitive function, bowel and bladder function, and eye movements are usually\npreserved. The disease is relentless and progressive: Affected individuals lose\ncontrol of voluntary movements, and respiratory paralysis ensues. Sensory and\nautonomic nerves are usually spared. ALS may be familial or acquired. The two\nforms are clinically and pathologically indistinguishable.\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;\n  </span>\n  <b>\n   <span>\n    &nbsp;\n   </span>\n  </b>\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <b>\n  <span>\n   Botulism.\n  </span>\n </b>\n <span>\n  Botulism is a rare, toxin-mediated,\nparalytic disease. The toxin is produced by the bacterium\n  <i>\n   Clostridium botulinum\n  </i>\n  . The disease may be acquired by bacterial\ncolonization of the digestive tract, by direct ingestion of toxin, or by wound\ncontamination. Paralysis typically starts with the cranial nerves and spreads\nto the limbs. The patient may present with double vision, drooping of the\neyelids, loss of facial expression, or difficulty with swallowing or talking.\nThe weakness then spreads to the arms (starting in the shoulders and proceeding\nto the forearms) and legs (starting with the thighs and proceeding to the\nfeet). The autonomic nervous sytem may be affected, causing dry mouth and\nthroat, postural hypotension, and constipation. Nausea and vomiting may occur,\nand, in severe forms, respiratory paralysis ensues.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <b>\n  <span>\n   Myasthenia gravis\n  </span>\n </b>\n <span>\n  .\n  <span>\n   Myasthenia gravis\n  </span>\n  is an autoimmune\nneuromuscular disease that causes fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigability.\nWeakness is caused by circulating antibodies that block acetylcholine receptors\nat the post-synaptic neuromuscular junction. The hallmark of myasthenia gravis\nis fatigability: Muscles become weaker with activity and stronger with rest.\nEspecially susceptible are the muscles that control eye and eyelid movements,\nfacial expression, chewing, talking, and swallowing. Presenting symptoms\ninclude ptosis, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, and change in facial expression.\nNeck and limb movements may be affected, gait may be unsteady, and breathing\nmay be impaired.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <b>\n  <span>\n   Multiple sclerosis\n  </span>\n </b>\n <span>\n  . Multiple sclerosis is\nan inflammatory disease in which the myelin sheaths around the axons of the\nbrain and spinal cord are damaged, leading to demyelination and scarring. (The\nmyelin sheath is usually around only the axon of a neuron. Schwann cells supply\nthe myelin for peripheral neurons, whereas oligodendrocytes myelinate the axons\nof the central nervous system.) Multiple sclerosis usually begins in young\nadults. Women are more commonly affected than men. Patients can have almost any\nneurological finding,\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;\n  </span>\n  including\nfatigue, visual changes, altered sensation, pain, muscle weakness, difficulty with\nmovement or balance, problems with speech or swallowing, and bowel or bladder\ndysfunction. Cognitive and mood changes may occur. Uhthoff&rsquo;s phenomenon\n(exacerbation of symptoms with exposure to heat) and Lhermitte&rsquo;s sign (an\nelectrical sensation running down the back when bending the neck) are characteristic\nbut not specific for multiple sclerosis.

The\nfirst-order neuron has its cell body in the trigeminal nerve ganglion. Its\ndendrites are sensory receptors and its axon enters the spinal trigeminal\nnucleus, which extends from the upper pons to the C2 level of the spinal cord.\nSecond-order neurons, whose cell bodies lie in the spinal trigeminal nucleus,\nsend their axons to the contralateral side, where they ascend in the\ncontralateral medial lemniscus and synapse with the third-order neurons in the\nthalamus. The third-order neurons send their neurons to the somatosensory\ncortex in the parietal lobe.

The only place where the spinothalamic\ntract receiving input from the left side of the body approximates the trigeminal\nsystem from the right side of the body is in the right brainstem between the\nupper pons and C2 (These are the upper and lower limits of the spinal\ntrigeminal nucleus).\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;\n  </span>\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Hoarseness\nand an abnormal gag reflex further localize the lesion (Figure 5-3). Hoarseness\nis caused by vocal cord dysfunction. The vocal cords are innervated by the\nvagus nerve from the nucleus ambiguus. The gag reflex involves cranial nerves\nIX and X. The afferent limb is supplied by the glossopharyngeal nerve and the\nefferent limb is supplied by the vagus nerve. Thus, dysfunction of the nucleus\nambiguus and the vagus nerve on the right side will cause hoarseness and right\npalatal paralysis. The nucleus ambiguus is located in the upper medulla.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  The\npatient has clumsiness and incoordination. These could be due to loss of\nposition sense, weakness, vestibular dysfunction, or cerebellar dysfunction.\nThe findings of ataxia (gross lack of coordination), dysmetria (inability to\njudge distance with the water hose), and intention tremor (right hand shaking\nwhen holding the water hose, but not at rest) suggest ipsilateral cerebellar\ndysfunction. We already suspect a lesion in the upper medulla due to the\npatient&rsquo;s hoarseness and palatal paralysis. The inferior cerebellar peduncle is\nlocated in the upper medulla; therefore, a lesion in the upper medulla could\nexplain the cerebellar findings (Figure 5-4).\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;\n  </span>\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  The\npatient also has vertigo, nausea, and nystagmus, which suggest vestibular\ndysfunction.

This sign is elicited by asking the patient to stand with his\nfeet together and with his eyes open, and then closed. If unsteadiness\nincreases when the eyes are closed, the patient is said to have Romberg&rsquo;s sign,\nwhich suggests proprioceptive or vestibular dysfunction. If unsteadiness does\nnot change, Romberg sign is said to be absent. Cerebellar dysfunction is\nassociated with an absent Romberg sign: Unsteadiness is equally severe with the\neyes opened and closed.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Finally,\nthe patient has Horner&rsquo;s syndrome &ndash; ptosis, miosis, and hemifacial\nanhidrosis &ndash; which indicates dysfunction of the sympathetic nervous\nsystem.

The upper motor neuron, or\ncorticospinal pathway, runs the entire length of the CNS. Muscles of the upper\nextremity are innervated by the C4-T1 spinal cord segments. Therefore, a lesion\nabove the C4 level would explain upper extremity weakness. The biceps reflex is\nsupplied by C5 and C6. Hyperactivity of that reflex indicates a lesion at or\nabove the C4 level.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Each\nfacial nerve nucleus is functionally divided into two separate regions, one\nthat supplies the muscles of the upper face and one that supplies the muscles\nof the lower face (Figure 2-3). The part that supplies the upper face receives\ninput from both cerebral hemispheres, while the part that supplies the lower\nface receives only contralateral input. Therefore, a lower motor neuron lesion\nwould result in loss of innervation to the upper and lower face. This is known\nas a &ldquo;peripheral&rdquo; type of facial weakness. A lesion of the contralateral\nhemisphere would result in a loss of innervation to the lower face. (The upper\nface would still be innervated by the intact ipsilateral hemisphere.) The patient\nwould be able to move the upper but not the lower face. This is known as a\n&ldquo;central&rdquo; type of facial weakness.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  In this\nvignette, both upper and lower parts of the face are affected, consistent with\na peripheral pattern. The lesion could be in the facial nucleus, the facial\nnerve fasciculus (the portion of the facial nerve within the brainstem), the\nperipheral nerve, the neuromuscular junction, or the muscle. Knowing that the\ncorticospinal tract is involved, the lesion must be in the CNS. Therefore, the problem\nmust lie in the facial nucleus or fasciculus, not in the peripheral nerve,\nneuromuscular junction, or muscle\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Only a\nlesion in the left pons could cause left facial weakness and right arm and leg\nweakness (Figure 2-4), as the facial nucleus and fasciculus are located in the\npons. This is an example of &ldquo;crossed paralysis&rdquo; in which there is cranial nerve\nweakness on one side of the body and extremity weakness on the other side.\nCrossed paralysis indicates a brainstem lesion. The slurred speech is caused by\nfacial weakness. (Certain sounds like &ldquo;me&rdquo; and &ldquo;pa&rdquo; require closure of the\nobicularis oris, which is affected in facial paralysis.)\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  The system\ninvolved in moving the eyes conjugately to the left originates in the right\nfrontal eye field of the cerebral cortex (Figure 2-5). Fibers descend through\nthe internal capsule to the right side of the midbrain. Here, fibers cross to\nthe left side at the level of the lower midbrain. These fibers then descend to\nthe lower pontine level and synapse in an area called the paramedian pontine\nreticular formation (PPRF). Fibers then leave the PPRF and synapse in the\nipsilateral abducens nucleus. There are two populations of neurons in the\nabducens nucleus: motor neurons, which run to the lateral rectus muscle to\nabduct the ipsilateral eye, and interneurons, which cross the midline at the\nlevel of the abducens nucleus to ascend in the contralateral medial\nlongitudinal fasciculus (MLF) and synapse in the medial rectus subnucleus of\nthe oculomotor nucleus. When the PPRF activates the abducens nucleus, the eyes\nmove conjugately to the ipsilateral side by innervating the ipsilateral lateral\nrectus and contralateral medial rectus muscles. A lesion of the PPRF or closely\nadjacent abducens nucleus produces horizontal gaze palsy when the patient tries\nto look toward the side of the lesion (as in this case).\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;\n  </span>\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  In this\nvignette, we have established that the lesion is in the left pons, because of\nthe presence of left facial weakness and right upper and lower extremity\nweakness.

In the pyramids of the medulla, it crosses to the right side and descends\nin the right lateral funiculus of the spinal cord.

As an extrinsic lesion\nexpands, more fibers are involved and the sensory symptoms appear to ascend.\nFibers of the corticospinal system are similarly laminated, and progressive\nspinal cord compression can cause an ascending pattern of weakness.

In the medulla, the first-order neurons from spinal segments\nbelow T6 synapse in the nucleus gracilis, while those from rostral spinal\nsegments synapse in the nucleus cuneatus. The second-order neuron axons cross\nto the other side to form the medial lemniscus. These fibers then ascend to\nsynapse with the third-order neurons in the thalamus.

The quantitative description of the study\nresults needs to include a measure of this uncertainty. The\n  <b>\n   confidence interval\n  </b>\n  is widely used to\nexpress the precision of the point estimate; a wide confidence interval\nindicates less precision, and a narrow confidence interval indicates more. In\ngeneral, the larger the study, the narrower the confidence interval. There are\nseveral cautions about interpreting confidence intervals correctly. First, the\nconfidence interval indicates only uncertainty that is due to the play of\nchance; it does not inform us about uncertainty in the results because of other\nfactors, such as confounders that have not been controlled for, or of\npeculiarities of the population that was studied, or poor study quality.\nSecond, a wide confidence interval does not mean there is no association\nbetween the exposure\n </span>\n <span>\n  and the outcome; even an imprecise point estimate\nremains the best explanation of\n </span>\n <span>\n  the relationship until a larger or better study is performed. Finally,\nconfidence intervals are often drawn as a straight line around the point\nestimate to show the width of their range; this might seem to suggest that the\nlocation of the true point estimate would be equally likely to fall anywhere\nwithin that interval. In fact, the confidence interval could better be shown as\na bell-shaped curve centered on the point estimate.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Relative risk estimates do not take into\naccount the incidence or the importance of the problem being evaluated. A\nrelative risk of 4 says that the outcome increases 400% in exposed individuals\ncompared with unexposed individuals. This increase often causes great worry or\nexcitement (particularly in the media). However, the relative risk must be\ninterpreted in the context of the frequency of the outcome. For instance, the\nincidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in young women without using oral\ncontraceptives is about 1 in 10,000, and the incidence while using oral\ncontraceptives is 4 in 10,000; thus, the relative risk is 4. However, the\n  <b>\n   absolute risk\n  </b>\n  of VTE is still low in\nboth groups of women with a difference in risk of 3 in 10,000. The risk in the\nexposed minus the risk in the unexposed is the risk difference.

An alternative calculation looks at the\ncomplementary concept: how many patients need to be treated to observe one\nbenefit or one adverse event? The\n  <span class=\"apple-converted-space\">\n   &nbsp;\n  </span>\n  <b>\n   number\nneeded to treat (NNT)\n  </b>\n  , the number of patients who need to be treated to\nachieve an additional positive outcome, is the reciprocal of the\n  <b>\n   absolute risk reduction\n  </b>\n  (the risk\ndifference for good outcomes).

When warfarin is\nadministered, anticoagulation does not occur immediately because it takes about\na day for the already-formed clotting factors to be metabolized.

It interacts with many\nfoods (particularly fresh plant-based foods containing vitamin K) and with many\ncommonly used medications (see below).
