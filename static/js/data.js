The classic form involves\nprior sensitization to an allergen with later re-exposure, producing symptoms\nvia an immunologic mechanism. The most common organ systems involved include\nthe cutaneous, respiratory, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal systems. The\nfull-blown syndrome includes urticaria (hives) and/or angioedema with\nhypotension and bronchospasm.&nbsp;\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Traditionally, the term\n&ldquo;anaphylaxis&rdquo; is reserved for reactions mediated by immunoglobulin E (IgE), and\nthe term &ldquo;anaphylactoid&rdquo; is reserved for IgE-independent events (which are\nclinically indistinguishable). Anaphylaxis is a type I hypersensitivity response.\nIgE production requires the secretion of cytokines from T\n <sub>\n  H\n </sub>\n 2 cells.\nThese cytokines induce B cells to switch antibody production to the IgE\nclass.&nbsp; The IgE binds to Fc\uf065 receptors on mast cells. When the\nantigen-binding region of IgE is cross-linked by allergens, mast cell\ndegranulation occurs, resulting in anaphylaxis.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The physiologic responses to\nthe release of anaphylaxis mediators include smooth muscle spasm in the\nrespiratory and gastrointestinal (GI) tracts, vasodilation, increased vascular\npermeability, and stimulation of sensory nerve endings. Increased mucous\nsecretion and increased bronchial smooth muscle tone, as well as airway edema,\ncontribute to the respiratory symptoms. Cardiovascular effects result from\ndecreased vascular tone and capillary leakage. Hypotension, cardiac\narrhythmias, syncope, and shock may result from intravascular volume loss,\nvasodilation, and myocardial dysfunction. These physiologic events lead to some\nor all of the classic symptoms of anaphylaxis: flushing; urticaria/angioedema;\npruritus; bronchospasm; laryngeal edema; abdominal cramping with nausea,\nvomiting, and diarrhea; and feeling of impending doom.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Anaphylaxis is a medical\nemergency that requires immediate recognition and intervention. Patients should\nreceive high-flow oxygen, cardiac monitoring, and intravenous access.\nEpinephrine maintains blood pressure, antagonizes the effects of the released\nmediators, and inhibits further release of mediators. Use of epinephrine for\nanaphylaxis has no absolute contraindications. It is the drug of choice and it\nis usually well tolerated and potentially lifesaving. Anaphylactic deaths\ncorrelate with delayed administration of epinephrine.

Gout is definitively diagnosed by demonstration of urate crystals in\naspirated synovial fluid.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Acute monoarticular\narthritis is the initial presentation in 90% of patients. Podagra, inflammation\nof the first metatarsophalangeal joint, is the initial joint manifestation in\n50% of cases (Figure 1). The attack begins abruptly and reaches maximum\nintensity within 8-12 hours. The joint is red, hot, and exquisitely tender;\neven a bed sheet on the swollen joint is uncomfortable. Untreated, the first\nattack resolves spontaneously in less than 2 weeks. Acute flares of gout can be\nprecipitated by events that raise serum uric acid levels, such as consumption\nof beer or liquor, overconsumption of high-purine foods, trauma, hemorrhage,\ndehydration, or the use of medications that raise uric acid levels (e.g.,\nthiazide diuretics).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Patients with gout are much\nmore likely to develop renal stones than are healthy individuals (by a factor\nof 1000). Although patients with gout often have other risk factors for renal\ndisease (e.g., hypertension and diabetes), chronic urate nephropathy can itself\ncontribute to renal insufficiency. Although gout typically causes joint\ninflammation, it can also cause inflammation of bursae and tendons. Tophi are\ncollections of urate crystals in the soft tissues. They can develop in patients\nwith untreated gout and may appear as lumps or nodules. While the classic\nlocation of tophi is along the helix of the ear, they can be found in other\nlocations, such as the fingers, toes, and olecranon bursae.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Gout is managed in three\nstages: (1) treating the acute attack, (2) providing prophylaxis to prevent\nacute flares, and (3) lowering excess stores of urate to prevent gouty flares\nand tissue deposition of urate crystals. Options for treating\n <i>\n  acute\n </i>\n gout\ninclude nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine, and\ncorticosteroids. NSAIDs are the drugs of choice in most patients\n <i>\n  .\n </i>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <i>\n  Long-term\n </i>\n management\nof gout focuses on lowering uric acid levels. (The goal of therapy is to lower\nserum uric acid levels to approximately 6 mg/dL or less.) Agents that lower\nuric acid levels should not be initiated during an acute attack, as they may\nintensify and prolong the attack. Typically, they should be started a few weeks\nafter the attack has resolved and with the protection of prophylactic\ncolchicine to prevent another attack.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Medicines available for\n <i>\n  chronic\n </i>\n management of gout include allopurinol and febuxostat, which reduce uric acid\nproduction by inhibiting the enzyme, xanthine oxidase; and probenecid and\nsulfinpyrzone, which enhance uric acid excretion by the kidney.\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n <a href=\"file://localhost/javascript/refimgshow(1)\">\n  <span>\n   <img alt=\"Description: Gout.

It is characterized by symmetrical,\npolyarticular pain and swelling, morning stiffness, and fatigue. RA has a\nvariable course, often with periods of exacerbations and, less frequently, true\nremissions. Outcomes are also variable, ranging from the rarely seen remitting\ndisease to severe disease that brings disability and even, in some patients,\npremature death. Without treatment, the majority of patients will experience\nprogressive joint damage. In some patients this results in significant\ndisability within just a few years. The past decade has seen an unprecedented\nchange in the treatment paradigm for this disease. Several targeted biologic\ntherapies are available; the most notable are the anti-tumor necrosis factor\n(TNF) therapies.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"8\" class=\"\" width=\"100%\">\n <tr>\n  <td width=\"96%\">\n   <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"\" width=\"100%\">\n    <tr>\n     <td width=\"100%\">\n      <p class=\"\">\n       <b>\n        <span>\n         Clinical Features\n        </span>\n       </b>\n      </p>\n     </td>\n    </tr>\n   </table>\n   <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"\" width=\"100%\">\n    <tr>\n     <td width=\"100%\">\n      <p class=\"\">\n       <a name=\"P079010\">\n       </a>\n       <span>\n        RA is a symmetrical\n    polyarthritis typically involving the small joints of the hands and feet,\n    the wrists, and the ankles.

First, insoluble calcium salts (primarily\nhydroxyapatite) provide the structural characteristics that allow bones to\nprotect internal organs, to bear weight, and to function as the levers on which\nmuscles act during locomotion. Second, soluble calcium ions in the\nextracellular fluid (ECF) and cytosol are critical for a myriad of biochemical\nreactions, signaling cascades, and electrical systems that are necessary for\nlife.\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Most of\nthe calcium in the body (about 99%) is found in bone. Only 1% is contained\nwithin the ECF and soft tissues. Therefore, the skeleton is called on as a\nsource of calcium when the ECF concentration falls. Of the total circulating\ncalcium, the ionized fraction is about 50%, with the remainder bound to serum\nproteins, primarily albumin. Only the ionized fraction of total serum calcium\nis physiologically important, and this component is regulated on a\nminute-to-minute basis.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Hormones and organ systems\nregulate the ECF ionized calcium concentration such that it is maintained in a\nvery narrow physiologic range. If the calcium level falls below the physiologic\nrange, PTH is rapidly secreted from the parathyroid glands and activates the\nrelease of calcium and phosphate from the skeleton.

If the amount of water ingested falls below the\namount of water lost, the serum sodium level rises, leading to hypernatremia.\nOrdinarily, a rise in the sodium level triggers thirst, which leads to\nincreased free water intake and subsequent correction of the abnormality.\nHypernatremia usually occurs in individuals who cannot adequately replace fluid\nlosses, such as infants, the mentally impaired, and the elderly.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Most patients with\nhypernatremia are hypovolemic.

Reduction in\naldosterone results in hyperkalemia and a normal-anion gap metabolic acidosis.\nThe combination of hyperkalemia and a normal anion gap acidosis suggests type\nIV RTA, or hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism.&nbsp;\n </span>\n</p>\n", "question": "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  A\n59-year-old man with diabetes, hypertension, and chronic renal insufficiency is\nseen for a routine clinic visit.&nbsp; He is feeling well.&nbsp; His only\nmedicines are metformin and amlodipine.&nbsp;\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Lab test\nresults show:\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Na\n  <sup>\n   +\n  </sup>\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 138\nmEq/L\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  K\n  <sup>\n   +\n  </sup>\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.5\nmEq/L\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Cl\n  <sup>\n   -\n  </sup>\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 110\nmEq/L\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  HCO\n  <sub>\n   3\n  </sub>\n  <sup>\n   -\n  </sup>\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 19\nmEq/L\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Glucose&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 188\nmg/dL\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  BUN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 25\nmg/dL\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Cr&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.0\nmg/dL\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Which of\nthe following best explains these values?\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  A.\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Diabetic ketoacidosis\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  B.\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Hyporeninemic\nhypoaldosteronism\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  C.\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Lactic acidosis\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  D.\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Metabolic acidosis\nsecondary to end-stage renal disease\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  E.\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Metabolic acidosis secondary\nto persistent diarrhea\n </span>\n</p>\n"}, {"answer": "<p class=\"\">\n <b>\n  <span>\n   Answer B\nis correct.\n  </span>\n </b>\n <span>\n  Angiotensin-converting\nenzyme is produced mainly by the pulmonary vascular endothelium.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <b>\n  <span>\n   Answer\nA is incorrect.\n  </span>\n </b>\n <span>\n  Renin\nis produced by juxtaglomerular cells in the kidney.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <b>\n  <span>\n   Answer\nC is incorrect.\n  </span>\n </b>\n <span>\n  Angiotensin I is converted to angiotensin II through removal of two C-terminal\nresidues by the enzyme\n  <span>\n   angiotensin-converting enzyme.\n  </span>\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <b>\n  <span>\n   Answer\nD is incorrect.\n  </span>\n </b>\n <span>\n  Aldosterone is produced by the zona glomerulosa cells of the adrenal\ngland.&nbsp;\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <b>\n  <span>\n   Answer\nE is incorrect.\n  </span>\n </b>\n <span>\n  Vasopressin is produced by the hypothalamus and stored in the posterior\npituitary.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"row\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\"row text-center\"><h4>Tutorial</h4></div>\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  The\npatient has symptoms and signs of congestive heart failure.

The five major types of\nadaptation are atrophy, hypertrophy, hyperplasia, dysplasia, and metaplasia.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <b>\n  Atrophy\n </b>\n is a decrease\nin cell size. If enough cells in an organ atrophy, the entire organ will\ndecrease in size. Thymus atrophy in childhood is an example of physiologic\natrophy. Skeletal muscle atrophy is a pathologic adaptation to skeletal muscle\ndisuse. Tissue and organs especially susceptible to atrophy include skeletal\nmuscle, cardiac muscle, secondary sex organs, and the brain.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <b>\n  Hypertrophy\n </b>\n is an\nincrease in cell size. If enough cells of an organ hypertrophy, the organ\nitself will enlarge. The heart and kidneys are especially susceptible to\nhypertrophy. Hypertrophy may be caused by mechanial signals (e.g., stretch) or\ntrophic signals (e.g., growth factors). Physiologic hypertrophy occurs in\nskeletal muscle with sustained weight-bearing exercise. Pathologic hypertrophy\noccurs in cardiac muscle as a result of hypertension.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <b>\n  Hyperplasia\n </b>\n is an\nincrease in the number of cells due to increased cell mitosis. Physiologic\nhyperplasia may be compensatory or hormonal. Compensatory hyperplasia permits\ntissue and organ regeneration. It is common in epithelial cells of the\nepidermis and intestine, hepatocytes, bone marrow cells, and fibroblasts.\nHormonal hyperplasia occurs mainly in organs that depend on estrogen (e.g.,\nendometrial cells during pregnancy). Pathologic hyperplasia is an abnormal\nincrease in cell division (e.g., endometriosis).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <b>\n  Metaplasia\n </b>\n occurs\nwhen a differentiated cell type is replaced by another cell type, which may be\nless differentiated. It is a reversible process. Metaplasia occurs in the\nrespiratory tract as a response to smoking. Bronchial cells convert from\nmucus-secreting, ciliated, columnar epithelium to non-mucous-secreting,\nnon-ciliated, squamous epithelium. The cells may become dysplasic or cancerous\nif the stimulus (e.g., cigarette smoking) is not removed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <b>\n  Dysplasia\n </b>\n refers to\nabnormal changes in cellular shape, size, and organization. Sometimes called\n\"atypical hyperplasia,&rdquo; dysplasia is not a true adaptation but, rather,\nthe earliest pre-cancerous lesion recognizable in a biopsy. Tissues prone to\ndysplasia include cervical and respiratory epithelia. Dysplasia can be mild\n(low-grade), moderate, or severe (high-grade). Mild dysplasia is at low risk of\ntransforming into cancer. Severe dysplasia is at high risk. In most organs,\ncarcinoma\n <i>\n  in situ\n </i>\n (CIS) is synonmyous with severe (high-grade)\ndysplasia. CIS immediately precedes the development of frank carcinoma and\nresembles invasive carcinoma except for the lack of basement membrane\ndisruption.&nbsp;\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span class=\"search-hit\">\n  Dysplasia\n </span>\n is encountered principally in epithelia, and it is characterized by a\nconstellation of changes that\n <span>\n  include a loss in the uniformity of the\nindividual cells as well as a loss in their architectural orientation\n </span>\n .\nDysplastic cells exhibit considerable pleomorphism and often contain large\nhyperchromatic nuclei with a high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio. The\narchitecture of the tissue may be disorderly. For example, in squamous\nepithelium the usual progressive maturation of tall cells in the basal layer to\nflattened squamous cells on the surface may be lost and replaced by a\nscrambling of dark basal-appearing cells throughout the epithelium. Mitotic\nfigures are more abundant than usual. Frequently, they appear in abnormal\nlocations within the epithelium. For example, in dysplastic stratified squamous\nepithelium, mitoses are not confined to the basal layers but instead may appear\nat all levels, including surface cells. When dysplastic changes are marked and\ninvolve the entire thickness of the epithelium but the lesion remains confined\nby the basement membrane, it is considered a preinvasive neoplasm and is\nreferred to as\n <i>\n  carcinoma in situ\n </i>\n .

Thus, the epithelium appears to have several layers. The term\n&ldquo;pseudostratified&rdquo; describes this arrangement.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The majority of cells\ncomposing the\n <i>\n  ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium\n </i>\n are of three\ntypes: a) ciliated cells, b) goblet cells, and c) basal cells. The ciliated\ncells are columnar epithelial cells with specialized ciliary modifications.\nGoblet cells, so named because they are shaped like a wine goblet, are columnar\nepithelial cells that secrete mucus. The basal cells are small, nearly cuboidal\ncells that differentiate into other cells types. They respond to epithelial\ninjury by migrating to the denuded site and differentiating to restore the\nepithelial cell layer.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Some of the earliest changes\nin smoking-damaged respiratory epithelium include goblet cell hyperplasia\n <b>\n  (A)\n </b>\n ,\nbasal cell hyperplasia\n <b>\n  (B)\n </b>\n , and squamous metaplasia\n <b>\n  (C)\n </b>\n .

It is an autosomal recessive disease caused by\ndeficiency of glucose-6-phosphatase. This deficiency inhibits two pathways needed\nto produce glucose in the liver: glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. The result\nis hypoglycemia, which occurs during periods of fasting. Glycogen accumulates\nin the liver and kidneys, causing enlargement of these organs.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Hepatic glycogen serves as a\nform of rapidly accessible glucose, allowing blood glucose levels to be\nmaintained between meals. For about three hours after a carbohydrate-containing\nmeal, insulin directs liver cells to take glucose from the blood, convert it to\nglucose-6-phosphate, and add this molecule to glycogen strands (glycogen\nsynthesis).&nbsp;\n</p>\n\n<p>\n When digestion of a meal is\ncomplete, insulin levels fall and glucose molecules are removed from glycogen\nin the form of glucose-6-phosphate. This process is called glycogenolysis. The\nglucose-6-phosphate remains in the liver cell until phosphate is cleaved by\nglucose-6-phosphatase. This dephosphorylation produces free glucose, which can\nbe transported out of the liver and into the blood, where it can travel to the\nbrain and other organs. Glycogenolysis can supply glucose needs for 12&ndash;18\nhours.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n When fasting continues for\nmore than a few hours, falling insulin levels permit catabolism of\ntriglycerides in adipose tissue and protein in muscle tissue. The products of\nthese processes are free fatty acids and amino acids, respectively. Free fatty\nacids are converted to acetyl-CoA, some of which is diverted to produce\nketones. Amino acids are used to synthesize new glucose-6-phosphate in liver\ncells by the process of gluconeogenesis. The last step of gluconeogenesis, like\nthe last step of glycogenolysis, is the dephosphorylation of\nglucose-6-phosphate to free glucose by glucose-6-phosphatase.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Thus, glucose-6-phosphatase\nmediates the final steps in both pathways of glucose production: glycogenolysis\nand gluconeogenesis.&nbsp;\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  The\nprincipal metabolic effects of glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency (glycogen\nstorage disease type I, or von Gierke&rsquo;s disease) are:\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  &middot;\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Hypoglycemia\n(fasting)\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  &middot;\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Lactic\nacidosis\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  &middot;\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Hyperuricemia\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  &middot;\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Hypertriglyceridemia&nbsp;\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <b>\n  <span>\n   Hypoglycemia\n  </span>\n </b>\n <span>\n  is &ldquo;fasting&rdquo; or\n&ldquo;post-absorptive&rdquo; because it occurs after digestion of the meal (usually about\nfour hours later).

Answering the question requires an understanding of\ncarbohydrate and lipid metabolism.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The brain depends on glucose\nfor fuel. The importance of glucose to the brain is apparent from the number of\nnervous, hormonal, and metabolic responses to falling glucose levels. The three\nmost important responses are\n <i>\n  glycogenolysis\n </i>\n ,\n <i>\n  gluconeogenesis\n </i>\n , and\n <i>\n  fatty acid oxidation.\n </i>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  When\nthe body is denied glucose for more than 4 hours, hepatic glycogen is used for\nfuel. Through glycogenolysis, glycogen is broken down to glucose monomers. The\nliver contains about 12 hours worth of glycogen. When hepatic glycogen is\ndepleted, three events occur. 1) Muscle glycogen is broken down, which may\ncontinue for days. 2) Gluconeogenesis occurs, in which glucose is generated\nfrom non-carbohydrate substrates. 3) Lipolysis occurs, in which fats\n(triglycerides) are broken down into glycerol and fatty acids.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Each\ntriglyceride molecule is composed of one glycerol and three fatty acid\nmolecules. Fatty acids are transported from the cytosol to the mitochondria by\ncarnitine (a quaternary ammonium compound). In the mitochondria, fatty acids\nare broken down through beta-oxidation to produce acetyl CoA, which enters the\nKrebs cycle to produce energy. If fatty acid breakdown is excessive, the Krebs\ncycle is overwhelmed and &ldquo;extra&rdquo; acetyl CoA is used to produce ketones, which\nthe brain uses for energy. (The brain cannot use fatty acids directly because\nthey do not cross the blood-brain barrier.)\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  The\nthree metabolic responses to hypoglycemia are regulated by hormones. As glucose\nlevels drop, insulin secretion is suppressed and counter-regulatory hormone\nsecretion is enhanced.

Ketones are formed by fatty acid oxidation. The\nprincipal ketones are acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate. Prolonged fasting\ncauses ketosis because a fall in blood glucose triggers lipolysis, fatty acid\noxidation, and ketone production.

Consider the following: If a silent\nmutation had occurred, the amino acid sequence would not have changed. If a\nmissense mutation had occurred, amino acid 11 would have changed, but amino\nacids 12-20 would have been the same. If a nonsense mutation had occurred, the\nsequence would have ended at amino acid 10, not amino acid 20. Therefore, a\nsubstitution mutation cannot explain the new sequence. The only way to explain\na change in sequence that encompasses the entire remaining length of the\nprotein is with a frameshift mutation. This mutation could be an insertion or a\ndeletion. Either way, the number of nucleotodes inserted or deleted would not\nbe divisible by three. (If the number were divisible by three, the reading\nframe would not have &ldquo;shifted.&rdquo;) The answer is, therefore, B (i.e., a deletion\nin codon 11) because this is the only option that produces a frameshift\nmutation at codon 11.

Research has shown that children\nwith hearing loss identified before six months of age and who have begun\nappropriate interventions immediately after diagnosis demonstrate superior\nlanguage skills over those identified after six months of age.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n About one in 1000 infants has profound hearing loss, with\nat least half of these cases thought to be of genetic origin. Despite this\nnumber, genetic causes of hearing loss are frequently undiagnosed. Also,\nchildren who are the only deaf individuals in their families may have a genetic\nor inherited cause for their deafness. There are many genes that contribute to\nhearing loss. These genes may be inherited in a variety of fashions: autosomal\ndominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked, or mitochondrial.\n <span>\n  Infection in the mother during pregnancy or illness of the\ninfant requiring care in a neonatal intensive care unit may result in isolated\nor sporadic cases of newborn hearing loss within families.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  The most common\ncause of congenital deafness in children is caused by a mutation (autosomal\nrecessive) of a gene called GBJ2.

Many people simply refer to the gene as the &ldquo;\n  <span>\n   connexin\n26 gene\n  </span>\n  .&rdquo; In two-thirds of persons with Cx26-related deafness, a single\nmutation is found called 35delG.

Hearing\nloss that accumulates with age but is caused by factors other than normal aging\nis not presbycusis. Deterioration in hearing has been found to start from about\nthe age of 18 years. Age affects high frequencies more than low frequencies and\nmen more frequently than women. One early consequence is that even young adults\nmay lose the ability to hear very high frequency tones. Despite this,\nage-related hearing loss may only become noticeable later in life. The effects\nof age can be exacerbated by exposure to environmental noise, whether at work\nor in leisure time (shooting, music, etc.).

DKA is commonly associated with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and\nfrequent urination (due to hyperglycemia). Ketones are produced in abundance,\nresulting in a metabolic acidosis with an increased anion gap. The main ketones\nare acetoacetate, &beta;-hydroxybutyrate, and acetone.

Under\nnormal conditions, acetyl-CoA is further oxidized and its energy transferred as\nelectrons to NADH, FADH\n <sub>\n  2\n </sub>\n , and GTP in the citric acid cycle (TCA\ncycle). However, if the amount of acetyl-CoA generated in &beta;-oxidation\n(fatty acid oxidation) overwhelms the processing capacity of the TCA cycle,\nacetyl-CoA is then used instead in the biosynthesis of ketones.\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  After they\nare produced in the liver, ketones are transported to other tissues, such as\nthe brain and heart. Ketones can cross the blood-brian barrier and enter the\ncentral nervous system. In the brain, they can be reconverted to acetyl-CoA to\nproduce energy, via the citric acid cycle. The heart has little need for\nketones, as it can burn fatty acids. The brain cannot burn fatty acids and must\nrely on ketones when glucose is not available.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The three principal ketones\nare acetoacetic acid, beta-hydroxybutyric acid, and acetone. Acetone is\nproduced by spontaneous decarboxylation of acetoacetate. It is not used as an\nenergy source, but is instead exhaled or excreted as waste.

An accumulation of pus in an enclosed tissue space is known as an\nabscess, whereas a visible collection of pus within or beneath the epidermis is\nknown as a pustule. Pus is comprised of dead leukocytes (mostly neutrophils) in\na protein-rich fluid. The fluid is usually whitish-yellow, but other colors can\noccur. (Blue-green pus may result from infection with\n <i>\n  Pseudomonas aeruginosa\n </i>\n <span>\n  and brown pus is typical of a\n </span>\n moebic abscesses in the liver.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n During infection,\nmacrophages and other cells of the innate immune system release chemokines that\ntrigger neutrophils to seek the site of infection (chemotaxis).

It functions, therefore, as\na transcriptional activator. Nuclear receptors are multi-domain proteins\nconsisting of a ligand binding domain (LBD), transactivation domain (AD), and\nDNA-binding domain (DBD). The effect of ligand binding has differing effects\ndepending on the specific hormone receptor.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  The\nglucocorticoid receptor is a soluble protein found in the cytosol and nucleus.\nIn the absence of ligand, it is tethered to other proteins in large aggregates\nin the cytosol. Upon binding to glucocorticoid, the conformation of the\nreceptor is altered, which allows its release from the protein aggregate. The\nfreed receptor then travels into the nucleus and binds to specific elements in\nthe promoters of certain genes. This binding causes the transactivation domain\nto recruit and facilitate assembly of the RNA polymerase II initiation complex,\nwhich transcribes DNA.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <img alt=\"Description: iMac HD:Users:Karla:Downloads:ch10f67.jpg\" border=\"0\" height=\"249\" id=\"Picture 25\" src=\"static/img/tutorials/image078.png\" width=\"434\"/>\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"row\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\"row text-center\"><h4>Tutorial</h4></div>\n<p>\n <span>\n  Receptors are proteins\nthat &ldquo;translate&rdquo; extracellular signals into intracellular effects. T\n </span>\n hey\nmay be located in the cell membrane or within the cytoplasm or nucleus.\nMolecules (e.g., drugs, hormones, neurotransmitters) that bind to receptors are\ncalled ligands. Ligands may activate or inactivate a receptor. Activated\nreceptors regulate cellular biochemical processes (e.g., ion conductance,\nenzymatic activity, DNA transcription).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Receptors are\n <span>\n  classified\ninto four major types:\n </span>\n &nbsp;\n</p>\n\n<p>\n 1.\n <span>\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n </span>\n Ligand-gated ion channels. These transmembrane receptors contain a\ncentral pore, or ion channel, which opens in response to the binding of a\nligand. The channel is usually selective to one or more ions (e.g., Na\n <sup>\n  +\n </sup>\n ,\nK\n <sup>\n  +\n </sup>\n , Ca\n <sup>\n  2+\n </sup>\n , or Cl\n <sup>\n  -\n </sup>\n ). Ion channels are especially\nimportant at certain neuronal synapses, where they convert chemical signals\nfrom neurotransmitters to electrical signals in the postsynaptic neuron. The\nprototype of a ligand-gated ion channel is the nicotinic acetylcholine\nreceptor. When acetylcholine binds to the receptor, the receptor&rsquo;s\nconfiguration changes, allowing the pore to open. Na\n <sup>\n  +\n </sup>\n ions flow down\nan electrochemical gradient into the cell. When many channels open at once, the\nintracellular Na\n <sup>\n  +\n </sup>\n concentration rises to a level at which the\npositive charge within the cell is enough to depolarize the membrane,\ninitiating an action potential.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n 2.\n <span>\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n </span>\n G-protein-coupled receptors.&nbsp; These transmembrane receptors do\n <i>\n  not\n </i>\n contain a central pore, or ion channel. Instead, they are\n <i>\n  indirectly\n </i>\n linked with ion channels through G- proteins, which serve as signal\ntransducers. G-proteins may activate other enzymes, such as adenyl cyclase or\nphospholipase. Because several steps exist between receptor activation and ion\nchannel opening, these ion channels take longer to open than ligand-gated ion\nchannels &ndash; and they stay open longer than ligand-gated channels.\nG-protein-coupled receptors include receptors for norepinephrine, epinephrine,\ndopamine, serotonin, histamine, muscarinic acetylcholine, and GABA\n <sub>\n  B\n </sub>\n .\n</p>\n\n<p>\n 3.\n <span>\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n </span>\n <span>\n  Enzyme-linked receptors. These\n </span>\n transmembrane receptors have\nenzymatic activity on the intracellular side, triggered by ligand binding on\nthe extracellular side. Most enzyme-linked receptors are tyrosine kinases,\nwhich phosphorylate tyrosine residues. Tyrosine kinases include the receptors\nfor insulin, peptide hormones, and growth factors (e.g., epidermal growth\nfactor, fibroblast growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n 4.\n <span>\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n </span>\n <span>\n  Nuclear receptors. These receptors are located in the cytosol or\nin the nucleus (rather than in the cell membrane). They\n </span>\n have the ability\nto directly bind DNA and regulate the expression of adjacent genes. These\nreceptors are considered transcriptional activators. Steroid hormones and\nthyroid hormones bind to nuclear receptors. There are two major types of nuclear\nreceptors. Class I receptors are located in the cytosol. When activated by\nligand, they translocate to the nucleus, bind to a specific DNA sequence, and\nenhance DNA transcription. Class II receptors are located in the nucleus\n(regardless of ligand-binding status). When bound by ligand, they promote DNA\ntranscription.\n</p>\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"\" width=\"375\">\n  <tr>\n   <td colspan=\"4\"

Mutations of these genes facilitate\nprogression to cancer.\n <span>\n  Unlike oncogenes\n </span>\n , tumor suppressor genes\ngenerally follow the &ldquo;two-hit hypothesis&rdquo;; i.e., two mutational events are\nrequired for tumor development\n <a name=\"4-u1.0-B978-1-4160-2450-7..50504-1--intr\">\n </a>\n .\n</p>\n\n<p>\n In the inherited form of\n <span class=\"search-hit\">\n  retinoblastoma\n </span>\n , both RB1 alleles are usually mutated.\nOne mutation is inherited through the germinal cells; the other occurs later in\nsomatic retinal cells. (Usually both alleles must be mutated because a single\nnormal allele can produce enough protein to prevent progression to cancer.)\nMutations of tumor suppressor genes are usually recessive; mutations of\noncogenes, by contrast, are usually dominant.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Tumor-suppressor genes work\nby inhibiting the cell cycle or by promoting apoptosis. The first\ntumor-suppressor gene discovered was the retinoblastoma gene, which codes for\nretinoblastoma protein (pRb). This protein blocks the cell cycle so that the\ncell cannot leave the G\n <sub>\n  1\n </sub>\n phase and enter the S phase. Thus, the cell\nremains stalled in the G\n <sub>\n  1\n </sub>\n phase. This is a protective mechanism. It\nprevents damaged DNA from replicating. If the retinoblastoma gene is mutated,\nreplication of damaged DNA goes unregulated, and cancer can occur.\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n <span>\n  <img alt=\"Description: Figure 24-9.

The main types of transplant rejection are\nhyperacute, acute, and chronic.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <i>\n  Hyperacute rejection\n </i>\n usually occurs within 24 hours of transplantation. The response is so quick\nthat the graft never becomes vascularized. Hyperacute rejection is\ncharacterized by thrombotic occlusions and hemorrhages of the graft vasculature\nthat begin minutes to hours after the graft is placed. These occur because of\npreexisting host antibodies that bind to antigens present in the graft\nendothelium. The complement system is activated and there is an influx of\nneutrophils. Endothelial cells and platelets shed lipid particles, which\npromote coagulation. The resulting inflammation prevents vascularization of the\ngraft. The graft suffers irreversible damage from ischemia.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n There are several\nexplanations for the preexisting antibodies that initiate hyperacute rejection.\nRecipients of blood transfusions sometimes develop antibodies to major\nhistocompatibility class (MHC) antigens from the transfused blood. If some of\nthese antigens match those in a graft, then hyperacute rejection may occur.\nMultiple pregnancies may also expose woman to the paternal antigens of the\nfetus, resulting in the creation of antibodies. Finally, prior recipients of\ntransplants may have already formed antibodies to other MHC antigens &ndash;\nantibodies that may be present at the time of a second transplant. Usually\nhyperacute rejection can be avoided by screening for anti-graft antibodies\n(crossmatching).&nbsp;&nbsp;\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <i>\n  <span>\n   Acute\nrejection\n  </span>\n </i>\n <span>\n  usually begins a week after transplantation and most likely occurs to some\ndegree in all transplants (except between identical twins). It is caused by\nmismatched HLA antigens that are present on all cells. HLA antigens are\npolymorphic; therefore, the chance of a perfect match is extremely rare. The\nreason that acute rejection occurs a week after transplantation is because the\nT cells involved in rejection must differentiate and the antibodies must be\nproduced before rejection is initiated. Some T cells cause graft cells to lyse;\nothers produce cytokines that recruit other inflammatory cells, eventually\ncausing necrosis of allograft tissue. Endothelial cells in vascularized grafts\nsuch as kidneys are some of the earliest victims of acute rejection. Damage to\nthe endothelial lining is an early predictor of irreversible acute graft\nfailure. The risk of acute rejection is highest in the first three months after\ntransplantation and is lowered by immunosuppressive agents. The diagnosis of\nacute rejection is based on clinical data, laboratory testing, and tissue\nbiopsy.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <i>\n  <span>\n   Chronic\nrejection\n  </span>\n </i>\n <span>\n  occurs months to years following transplantation. It is characterized by graft\narterial occlusions, which result from the proliferation of smooth muscle cells\nand the production of collagen by fibroblasts. This process, termed accelerated\nor graft arteriosclerosis, results in fibrosis, which can cause ischemia and\ncell death. The fibrous lesions occur without evidence of an overt cause (such\nas vascular injury or infection), although it is hypothesized that chronic\nrejection is the result of multiple acute rejections. This hypothesis is based\non the knowledge that the resulting fibrosis is similar to the fibrosis that\naccompanies the natural healing of a wound. Now that there are treatments for\nacute rejection, chronic rejection is the major cause of graft loss. Most\nrecipients must take immunosuppressive drugs for the rest of their lives, and\neven that may not be enough to combat chronic rejection. This poses a dilemma\nin the trend of immunotherapy, since immunosuppression is highly focused to\nprevent acute rejection and does not substantially address chronic rejection\nmechanisms.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <i>\n  Graft-versus-host disease\n </i>\n (GVHD) is a common complication of allogeneic bone marrow\n <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hematopoietic_stem_cell_transplantation\" title=\"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation\">\n </a>\n transplantation in which\nfunctional T cells in the transplanted marrow recognize the recipient as\n\"foreign\" and mount an immunologic attack.\n <i>\n  Acute\n </i>\n graft-versus-host-disease occurs within the first 100 days and is characterized\nby selective damage to the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and skin.\nGastrointestinal involvement may result in severe intestinal inflammation,\nsloughing of the mucosal membrane, severe diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and\nvomiting.

Most tumor markers are made by normal cells as well as by cancer cells;\nhowever, they are produced at much higher levels in cancerous conditions. These\nsubstances can be found in the blood, urine, stool, tumor tissue, or other tissues\nor bodily fluids of some patients with cancer. Most tumor markers are proteins.\nHowever, more recently, patterns of gene expression and changes to DNA have\nalso begun to be used as tumor markers. Markers of the latter type are assessed\nin tumor tissue specifically.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Thus far, more than 20\ndifferent tumor markers have been characterized and are in clinical use. Some\nare associated with only one type of cancer, whereas others are associated with\ntwo or more cancer types. There is no &ldquo;universal&rdquo; tumor marker that can detect\nany type of cancer.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n There are some limitations\nto the use of tumor markers. Sometimes, noncancerous conditions can cause the\nlevels of certain tumor markers to increase. In addition, not everyone with a\nparticular type of cancer will have a higher level of a tumor marker associated\nwith that cancer. Moreover, tumor markers have not been identified for every\ntype of cancer.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Some of the most commonly\nused tumor markers appear below.\n</p>\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n <table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"\">\n  <tr>\n   <td valign=\"top\" width=\"96\">\n    <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n     <b>\n      <span>\n       Tumor Marker\n      </span>\n     </b>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n   <td valign=\"top\" width=\"105\">\n    <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n     <b>\n      <span>\n       Cancer Type\n      </span>\n     </b>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n   <td valign=\"top\" width=\"86\">\n    <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n     <b>\n      <span>\n       Tissue Analyzed\n      </span>\n     </b>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n   <td valign=\"top\" width=\"110\">\n    <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n     <b>\n      <span>\n       How Used\n      </span>\n     </b>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td valign=\"top\" width=\"96\">\n    <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n     <span>\n      Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)\n     </span>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n   <td valign=\"top\" width=\"105\">\n    <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n     <span>\n      Liver cancer;\n      <br/>\n      germ cell tumors\n     </span>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n   <td valign=\"top\" width=\"86\">\n    <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n     <span>\n      Blood\n     </span>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n   <td valign=\"top\" width=\"110\">\n    <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n     <span>\n      To help diagnose liver cancer and follow\n  response to treatment;

It causes a chronic low-level\ninflammation of the stomach lining and is strongly linked to the development of\nduodenal and gastric ulcers and stomach cancer. Over 80% of individuals\ninfected with the bacterium are asymptomatic. The bacterium produces urease,\nwhich converts urea to ammonia and carbon dioxide. Four tests are available for\ndetecting\n  <i>\n   H. pylori\n  </i>\n  <span>\n   : blood antibody test, urea breath test, stool\nantigen test, and stomach biopsy. During the urea breath test, p\n  </span>\n  atients\nswallow urea labelled with an uncommon isotope, either radioactive carbon-14 or\nnon-radioactive carbon-13. In the subsequent 10&ndash;30 minutes, the detection\nof isotope-labelled carbon dioxide in exhaled breath indicates that the urea\nwas split; this indicates that urease is present in the stomach, and hence that\n  <i>\n   H. pylori\n  </i>\n  bacteria are present. The\n  <span>\n   Rapid urease test\n  </span>\n  , also\nknown as the CLO test (Campylobacter-like organism test), is a rapid test for\ndiagnosis of\n  <i>\n   Helicobacter pylori\n  </i>\n  . The test is performed at the time of\ngastroscopy. A biopsy of mucosa is taken from the antrum of the stomach, and is\nplaced into a medium containing urea and an indicator such as phenol red. The\nurease produced by\n  <i>\n   H. pylori\n  </i>\n  hydrolyzes urea to ammonia, which raises\nthe pH of the medium, and changes the color of the specimen from yellow\n(negative) to red (positive).\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  L.\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  11.\n  <i>\n   Clostridium\ndifficile\n  </i>\n  <span>\n   is the most common infectious cause of\nantibiotic-associated colitis.\n  </span>\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  M.\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  13.&nbsp; Respiratory\nsyncytial virus (\n </span>\n <span>\n  RSV)\nis the most common cause of bronchiolitis (and pneumonia) in children under 1\nyear of age.

Small-bowel\ndiarrhea tends to produce postprandial stools that are very large in volume.\nThese patients also often have severe postprandial peri-umbilical abdominal\npain. Diarrhea can be lessened by the avoidance of food and nutrients. Weight\nloss commonly occurs in these patients. By contrast, large-intestinal diarrhea,\nalso called &ldquo;colitic diarrhea,&rdquo; is associated with frequent, small-volume\nstools. These patients do not commonly become dehydrated. Colonic diarrhea may\nalso be associated with the presence of visible blood and mucus.

Endotoxins are largely responsible for the\ndramatic clinical manifestations of infections with pathogenic Gram-negative\nbacteria.\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n <span>\n  <img alt=\"Description: http://www.glycosan.com/images/endotoxin_structure.jpg\" border=\"0\" height=\"233\" id=\"Picture 347229\" src=\"static/img/tutorials/image098.png\" width=\"231\"/>\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n Endotoxin\n</p>\n\n<p>\n A comparison of endotoxin\nand exotoxins appears below.\n</p>\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"\">\n <tr>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     &nbsp;\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Endotoxin\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Exotoxin\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     &nbsp;\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     &nbsp;\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     &nbsp;\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Disease\n  (examples)\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Gram-negative\n  sepsis\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Tetanus,\n  Botulism, Diphtheria\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Source\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Lipopolysaccharide\n  found in the cell wall of most gram-negative bacteria; released when lysed\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Polypeptide\n  secreted by certain species of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Gene\n  location\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Bacterial\n  chromosome\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Plasmid\n  or bacteriophage\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Clinical\n  effects\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Fever,\n  shock\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Depends\n  on toxin\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Antigenicity\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Poorly\n  antigenic\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Induces\n  high-titer antibodies, called antitoxins\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Vaccines\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     None\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Toxoids\n  used as vaccines\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Heat\n  stability\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Stable\n  at 100\n     <sup>\n      o\n     </sup>\n     C for 1 hour\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"160\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Destroyed\n  rapidly at 60\n     <sup>\n      o\n     </sup>\n     C\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n</table>\n", "question": "<p>\n A 57-year-old woman with a\nhistory of frequent urinary tract infections has fever, nausea, flank pain, and\nmuscle aches.

The diarrhea is usually non-bloody and may be accompanied by\nfever and abdominal pain.\n <i>\n  Clostridium difficile\n </i>\n colitis is classically\nassociated with clindamycin use, but any broad-spectrum antibiotic can cause\nthe condition. &ldquo;Pseudomembranes,&rdquo; patches of yellowish exudate comprised of\ninflammatory debris, can be seen using sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy (hence, the\nterm &ldquo;pseudomembranous colitis&rdquo;).&nbsp; Clostridia are Gram-positive,\nanaerobic, spore-forming bacilli.&nbsp; Eradication of normal gut flora with\nantibiotic use causes overpopulation of these bacteria, which naturally reside\nin the colon. The bacteria release toxins that can cause bloating, diarrhea,\nand abdominal pain. There are several known toxins. The best-characterized are\nenterotoxin (\n <span>\n  toxin A\n </span>\n ) and cytotoxin (\n <span>\n  toxin B\n </span>\n ), both\nof which cause diarrhea and inflammation. Enzyme-linked immunoabsorbant assays\n(ELISA) are available for detecting toxins A and B in the stool. Experts\nrecommend sending as many as three stool samples for ELISA testing if initial\ntests are negative. Patients with\n <i>\n  C. difficile\n </i>\n <span>\n  colitis should be\ntreated with oral\n </span>\n metronidazole or vancomycin. If treatment is\neffective, the toxin clears from the stool.&nbsp;\n</p>\n\n<p>\n D\n <span>\n  iphtheria\n </span>\n is\nan upper respiratory tract illness caused by\n <i>\n  Corynebacterium diphtheriae\n </i>\n ,\na Gram-positive bacterium. The condition is characterized by sore throat, low\nfever, and an adherent membrane (a &ldquo;\n <span>\n  pseudomembrane&rdquo;\n </span>\n ) on the\ntonsils, pharynx, or nasal cavity. Patients may present with a &ldquo;bull&rdquo; neck.\nDiphtheria has largely been eradicated in industrialized nations through\nwidespread vaccination. The vaccine is composed of the diphtheria toxoid.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Cholera\n </span>\n is an\ninfection of the small intestine caused by the bacterium\n <i>\n  Vibrio cholerae\n </i>\n .\nThe main symptoms are profuse watery diarrhea and vomiting. The diarrhea is\nfrequently described as \"rice water.\" An untreated person may produce\n10-20 liters of stool a day. Disease transmission is primarily through\nconsumption of contaminated water or food. The severity of the diarrhea and\nvomiting can lead to rapid dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Primary\ntreatment is rehydration. Cholera affects 3-5 million people worldwide and\ncauses more than 100,000 deaths each year.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <i>\n  <span>\n   Escherichia coli\n  </span>\n </i>\n <span>\n  O157:H7\n </span>\n is an enterohemorrhagic strain of the bacterium\n <i>\n  Escherichia\ncoli\n </i>\n <span>\n  .\n </span>\n Infection often leads to hemorrhagic diarrhea and,\noccasionally, to renal failure, especially in young children and the elderly.\nTransmission is via the fecal-oral route.\n <i>\n  E. coli\n </i>\n is a Gram-negative\nbacillus, of which there are hundreds of serotypes. Most are harmless. Serotype\nO157:H7, however, can produce Shiga-like toxins, which cause severe illness. In\nsome individuals (particularly children under five years of age and the\nelderly), infection can lead to hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a condition characterized\nby hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure. In HUS,\nbacterial toxins stimulate platelet activation and the formation of\nmicrothrombi in arterioles and capillaries. Platelets are consumed and red\nblood cells are damaged as they squeeze through the narrowed blood vessels.\nThis process is called \"microangiopathic hemolysis.\" Schistocytes, or\nfragments of sheared red blood cells, appear in the blood and are a key finding\nin the diagnosis of HUS.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Pertussis\n </span>\n , also\nknown as\n <span>\n  whooping cough,\n </span>\n is a highly contagious disease caused by\nthe bacterium\n <i>\n  Bordetella pertussis\n </i>\n . The condition lasts about six weeks\nand is named after the \"whoop\" sound made from the inspiration of air\nafter a cough. (The high-pitched &ldquo;whoop&rdquo; occurs mainly in infants and\nchildren.) The classic symptoms are paroxysmal cough, inspiratory whoop, and\npost-tussive vomiting (after-cough vomiting). The cough is violent and has been\nassociated with subconjunctival hemorrhage, rib fracture, and syncope. Patients\npresent with mild respiratory symptoms, such as sneezing, runny nose, and cough\n(catarrhal stage). After one to two weeks, the cough develops into\nuncontrollable fits, each followed by a high-pitched \"whoop\" (in\nyounger children) or a gasp (in older children). This is the paroxysmal stage.\nThe &ldquo;whoop&rdquo; or gasp occurs as the patient struggles to inhale. Between coughing\nfits, the patient often appears well. The pertussis vaccine, an acellular\nvaccine, saves many lives each year.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Gas gangrene\n </span>\n (also known as \"Clostridial myonecrosis\" or \"myonecrosis\")\nis a deadly form of gangrene usually caused by\n <i>\n  Clostridium perfringens.\n </i>\n The condition usually occurs at the site of trauma or a recent surgical wound.\nThe onset of illness is sudden and dramatic. Predisposing conditions include\nperipheral arterial disease and diabetes. Clostridia produce many different\ntoxins that can cause potentially deadly syndromes. The site of infection\nbecomes inflamed, swollen, and very tender. Palpation of the region elicits\ncrackling because of subcutaneous gas. Vesicles appear which merge into large\nblisters. A serosanguinous discharge is common. The edge of the infected area\nmay expand over minutes. High fever, tachycardia, sweating, and exquisite pain\nare typical.&nbsp; If the condition is not treated, shock ensues and death soon\nfollows.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Toxic shock syndrome usually\nresults from infection with\n <i>\n  Staphylococcus aureus\n </i>\n <span>\n  . Patients\npresent with\n </span>\n high fever, low blood pressure, and confusion, which may\nprogress rapidly to stupor, coma, and multi-organ failure. The characteristic\nrash, often seen early in the course of illness, resembles sunburn, and can\ninvolve any region of the body, including the lips, mouth, eyes, palms and\nsoles. D\n <span>\n  esquamation occurs\n </span>\n after 10&ndash;14 days. Toxic shock\nsyndrome is caused by a superantigen toxin, which is produced by\n <i>\n  Staphylococcus\naureus\n </i>\n <span>\n  . The superantigen is called toxic shock syndrome toxin 1\n(TSST-1).\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Scarlet fever\n </span>\n is caused by an exotoxin (&ldquo;erythrogenic toxin&rdquo;) produced by\n <i>\n  Streptococcus\npyogenes\n </i>\n . The disease is characterized by high fever, sore throat,\ntonsillar exudate, cervical lymphadenopathy, bright red tongue (&ldquo;strawberry\ntongue&rdquo;), and characteristic rash. The rash is fine, red, and rough-textured.\nIt usually appears on the neck and face, often leaving a clear unaffected area\naround the mouth. It then spreads to the chest, back, and extremities. Classic\nred streaks that run together (Pastia lines) appear in body creases, especially\nthe axillae, elbows, and groin. The rash blanches with pressure and fades by\nthe sixth day. The affected skin desquamates. Blood tests show marked\nleukocytosis and an elevated antistreptolysin O titer. Streptococci may be\ncultured from the throat. Two types of complications are possible: &ldquo;septic&rdquo; and\n&ldquo;immune.&rdquo; Septic complications result from bacteremia, and include sinusitis,\npneumonia, and meningitis. Immune complications include acute\nglomerulonephritis, rheumatic fever and erythema nodosum.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Botulism\n </span>\n is a\nparalytic illness caused by botulinum toxin, which is produced by the bacterium\n <i>\n  Clostridium botulinum\n </i>\n <span>\n  . The toxin prevents the release of\nacetylcholine at motor nerve endings in the parasympathetic system. It\n </span>\n enters the body in one of three ways: by colonization of the digestive tract by\nthe bacterium, by ingestion of toxin from foods, or by bacterial wound\ncontamination.&nbsp; All forms lead to paralysis, which typically starts with\nthe muscles of the face and spreads to the limbs. Initial manifestations\ninclude blurred vision, ptosis, loss of facial expression, swallowing problems,\nand difficulty speaking. Severe botulism can lead to respiratory failure. The\nautonomic nervous system may be impaired, causing dry mouth, postural\nhypotension, and constipation.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Tetanus\n </span>\n is\ncharacterized by prolonged contraction of skeletal muscle. The condition is\ncaused by a neurotoxin produced by the Gram-positive, anaerobic bacterium\n <i>\n  Clostridium\ntetani\n </i>\n . The toxin acts by binding inhibitory neurons, blocking the release\nof neurotransmitters. Infection generally occurs through wound contamination.\n <span>\n  Generalized\ntetanus\n </span>\n occurs in 80% of cases and follows a descending pattern. The\nfirst sign is trismus (&ldquo;lockjaw&rdquo;) and facial spasm, followed by stiffness of\nthe neck, difficulty swallowing, and rigidity of pectoral and calf muscles.\nOther findings include elevated temperature, elevated blood pressure, rapid\nheart rate, and sweating. The tetanus vaccine, composed of tetanus toxoid, is\nvery effective at preventing disease.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Staphylococcal scalded\nskin syndrome\n </span>\n is induced by epidermolytic exotoxins A and B, which are\nreleased by\n <i>\n  Staphylococcus aureus\n </i>\n and cause detachment within the\nepidermal layer. The exotoxins are proteases that cleave desmoglein-1, which\nholds the granulosum and spinosum layers of the epidermis together. The disease\nmost commonly affects neonates and usually begins with fever, irritability, and\na faint rash. Within 1-2 days, the rash progresses to a blistering eruption.\nTissue paper-like wrinkling of the epidermis occurs and large bullae appear. As\nsheets of epidermis are shed, a moist erythematous base is revealed. Although\nthe clinical picture is dramatic, the process usually ends with desquamation,\nand healing is complete in 5-7 days.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Staphylococcal food\npoisoning is caused by enterotoxins produced by\n <em>\n  Staphylococcus aureus\n </em>\n <em>\n  <span>\n   . The bacteria multiply in food, where they produce\nheat-resistant enterotoxins (toxins that cannot be destroyed by cooking). When\ningested, the\n  </span>\n </em>\n toxins are fast-acting, sometimes causing illness in\nas little as thirty minutes. On average, symptoms occur one to six hours after\neating, and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. The illness\nis usually brief, and most patients recover in one to three days.\n <span>\n  Foods associated with staph food poisoning include meats;\npoultry and egg products; salads such as egg, tuna, chicken, potato, and\nmacaroni; bakery products such as cream-filled pastries, cream pies, and\nchocolate &eacute;clairs; sandwich fillings; and milk and dairy products.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Anthrax\n </span>\n is a\ndisease caused by the bacterium\n <i>\n  Bacillus anthracis\n </i>\n . The bacterium enters\nthe body through the lungs, intestines, or skin. Symptoms depend on site of\nentry. Lung infection causes flu-like symptoms, followed by respiratory\ncollapse. Intestinal infection causes abdominal pain, hematemesis, and\ndiarrhea. Cutaneous infection results in a boil-like lesion that forms a large,\npainless, necrotic ulcer. Anthrax can be contracted in laboratory accidents or\nby handling infected animals or their wool or hides.\n</p>\n", "question": "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Each of\nthe following clinical vignettes describes a condition that is caused by an\nexotoxin-producing bacterium.

The inflammatory\nresponse that accompanies infection is usually marked by fever.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Fever is\nan elevation in body temperature above the normal range in response to a\ncentral nervous system change in the set point. Normal oral temperature ranges\nfrom 36.0 to 37.7&deg; C, with a circadian variation of 1&deg; C or more between the\nmorning nadir and the evening peak. Mean oral temperature in healthy adults is\n36.8 &plusmn; 0.4&deg; C, with women exhibiting slightly higher values than men. Rectal\ntemperatures are 0.4&deg; C higher than oral and 0.8&deg; C higher than aural (tympanic\nmembrane) temperatures. Clinicians generally define significant fever as a\ntemperature higher than 38.3&deg; C (101.0&deg; F).\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  The vast\nmajority of acute febrile illnesses lasting less than two weeks have an\ninfectious cause. These infections occur predominantly where body surfaces\ninteract with the environment, such as the upper and lower respiratory tracts,\ngastrointestinal and genitourinary systems, and skin. The majority of acute\nrespiratory and gastrointestinal infections are viral in nature. As the\nduration of the febrile illness lengthens beyond three weeks, other\ninflammatory illnesses become more prominent in the differential diagnosis.\nMost chronic febrile illnesses are not caused by infection.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <a name=\"4-u1.0-B978-1-4377-1604-7..00288-8--s001\">\n </a>\n <a name=\"4-u1.0-B978-1-4377-1604-7..00288-8--st00\">\n </a>\n <span>\n  Infection ensues when a pathogen overcomes both\nnonspecific innate and specific adaptive humoral and cellular immune responses.\nThe normal indigenous microflora, host physical barriers (e.g., skin, mucous\nmembranes, cilia), and soluble factors (e.g., cytokines, complement) provide\nimportant barricades to pathogen invasion. Disruption of these barriers, which\nprovide a first line of defense, permits the invasion of pathogens.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  The acute\nphase response triggered by such disruption provides direct antimicrobial\nactivity and prompts the development of adaptive immunity mediated by\nlymphocytes and macrophages. This inflammatory response plays an important role\nin containing infection. Unfortunately, an exaggerated response may worsen the\nclinical condition.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Body\ntemperature is regulated both physiologically and behaviorally. Basal metabolic\nprocesses, governed especially by thyroid hormones but also by catecholamines\nand growth hormone, are responsible for the normal resting body temperature.\nThermogenesis may be increased up to 80% by hyperthyroidism and decreased as\nmuch as 50% by hypothyroidism. Moderate activity increases thermogenesis and\nresults in a transiently increased temperature until heat-dissipating processes\nare engaged.&nbsp;\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  The\nhypothalamus contains temperature-sensitive neurons that have receptors for\npro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, which are continuously\nbalanced to maintain a homeothermic set point. When body temperature becomes\nelevated, cutaneous vasodilation and sweating occur, and people may reduce\nactivity and seek a cooler environment. In contrast, low body temperature is\nincreased by shivering, piloerection, cutaneous vasoconstriction, adding\nclothes, and seeking a warmer environment.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  In febrile\nillness, symptoms are often due to the fever itself. Malaise is the rule, and\nmany febrile patients experience myalgia secondary to muscle contractions used\nto raise temperature. The chill associated with rigors may be related to\nsurface vasoconstriction that accompanies the increase in core temperature. The\nbody&rsquo;s thermoregulatory mechanisms rarely allow fevers to exceed 41&deg; C (106&deg;\nF). Temperatures exceeding 41&deg; C are often due to a drug-induced imbalance in\nthese mechanisms and may cause direct cellular damage.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Fever is a\ncomplex physiologic process involving metabolic and immunologic responses.\nBacteria release cell wall products such as peptidoglycans and endotoxin, as\nwell as enterotoxins, which bind to Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on phagocytes\n(neutrophils, macrophages) and endothelial cells. As a result, pyrogenic\ncytokines such as interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor\n(TNF)-&alpha; are released into the circulation and bind to cytokine receptors\nin the hypothalamus. This stimulates the brain to produce prostaglandin E\n  <sub>\n   2\n  </sub>\n  (PGE\n  <sub>\n   2\n  </sub>\n  ) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which trigger\nneurons in the thermoregulatory center to raise the hypothalamic thermostatic\nset point. In addition, neuronal signals to the cortex prompt behavioral\nchanges to conserve heat (e.g., shivering, adding clothing). The hypothalamus\nalso triggers sympathetic peripheral efferent nerves that constrict peripheral\nblood vessels and conserve central heat.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Leukocytosis\noften occurs in response to infection. Neutrophilia is the norm in most acute infections,\nwhatever the cause. Neutropenia may be seen in rickettsial, severe viral and\noverwhelming bacterial infections. Eosinophilia is typical of invasive\nhelminthic and some protozoal infections. Lymphocytosis may accompany many\nviral and rickettsial infections and is common during convalescence from acute\nbacterial infection. Monocytosis may be seen in tuberculosis. Virtually all\ninfections have an impact on the erythroid system, but given the long half-life\nof erythrocytes, usually only chronic infections or other inflammatory diseases\nresult in anemia.

Reactions range from minor to deadly, and typically\noccur 15-30 minutes after antigen exposure.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Immediate\nhypersensitivity is mediated by\n  <b>\n  </b>\n  IgE. The primary cellular component is\nthe mast cell or basophil. The reaction is amplified by neutrophils,\neosinophils, and platelets. Biopsy of affected tissue demonstrates mainly\n  <b>\n  </b>\n  mast\ncells and eosinophils. IgE is produced in response to certain allergens. It has\na very high affinity for receptor on mast cells and basophils.

MHC molecules play an important role in the immune\nsystem and autoimmunity.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Proteins are continually\nsynthesized and destroyed in the cell. These include normal proteins (self) and\nmicrobial pathogens (nonself). The MHC proteins act as &ldquo;signposts&rdquo; that serve\nto alert the immune system if foreign material is present inside a cell. They\nachieve this by displaying fragmented pieces, or\n <i>\n  antigens\n </i>\n <span>\n  ,\n </span>\n on the host cell&rsquo;s surface. These antigens may be\n <i>\n  self\n </i>\n or\n <i>\n  nonself\n </i>\n .\n(The protein fragment is sometimes compared to a hot dog, and the MHC protein\nto the bun.) The presentation of MHC/peptide on cell surfaces allows for\npathogen surveillance by immune cells, usually T cells or natural killer (NK)\ncells. If T cells or NK cells recognize an MHC/peptide combination, the cells\nbecome activated and launch an immune response against the presented antigen.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Because MHC genes must\ndefend against a great variety of microbes in the environment, the MHC\nmolecules (coded for by the MHC genes) must be able to present a wide range of\npeptides. MHC genes achieve this through several mechanisms: (1) the MHC locus\nis polygenic, (2) MHC genes are highly polymorphic and numerous alleles exist,\nand (3) several MHC genes are codominantly expressed.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n There are two general\nclasses of MHC molecules: Class I and Class II. Class I MHC molecules are found\non all nucleated cells and present peptides to cytotoxic T cells. Class II MHC\nmolecules are found on certain immune cells, chiefly macrophages, B cells and\ndendritic cells, collectively known as professional antigen-presenting cells\n(APCs). These APCs specialize in the uptake of pathogens and subsequent\nprocessing into peptide fragments within phagosomes. The Class II MHC molecules\non APCs present these fragments to helper T cells, which stimulate an immune\nreaction from other cells.\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  There are\ntwo classical pathways by which proteins can be processed and displayed.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  1.\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Phagocytic cells such as\nmacrophages and immature dendritic cells engulf pathogens in a process known as\nphagocytosis. Pathogen-containing endosomes then fuse with lysosomes and\nmediate their destruction. Degraded particles are then loaded onto MHC Class II\nmolecules and trafficked to the cell surface.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  2.\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  All nucleated cells can\nalso present cytosolic peptides on their class I MHC. This pathway is\nparticularly important during infection by a bacterium or virus, or if the cell\nis cancerous. In a normal cell, class I MHC continually present self-peptides\nderived from basal protein turnover and defective ribosomal products.

The terms &ldquo;giant-cell arteritis&rdquo; and\n&ldquo;temporal arteritis&rdquo; are sometimes used interchangeably, because of the\nfrequent involvement of the temporal artery. However, it can involve other\nlarge vessels (such as the aorta).

The inflammation is usually caused by\nmicrobial infection and less commonly by certain drugs. Meningitis can be\nlife-threatening because of the inflammation&rsquo;s proximity to the brain and\nspinal cord; therefore the condition is classified as a medical emergency.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The most common symptoms of\nmeningitis are headache and neck stiffness associated with fever, confusion or\naltered consciousness, vomiting, and an inability to tolerate light\n(photophobia) or loud noises (phonophobia). Sometimes, especially in small\nchildren, only nonspecific symptoms may be present, such as irritability and\ndrowsiness. If a rash is present, it may indicate a particular cause of\nmeningitis; for instance, meningitis caused by meningococcal bacteria may be\naccompanied by a characteristic rash.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n A lumbar puncture may be\nused to diagnose or exclude meningitis. This involves inserting a needle into\nthe spinal canal to extract a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the fluid\nthat envelops the brain and spinal cord. The CSF is then examined in a medical\nlaboratory. The usual treatment for meningitis is the prompt application of\nantibiotics (for bacterial meningitis).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Meningitis can lead to\nserious long-term consequences such as deafness, epilepsy, hydrocephalus and\ncognitive deficits, especially if not treated quickly. Some forms of meningitis\n(such as those associated with meningococci,\n <i>\n  Haemophilus influenzae\n </i>\n type\nB, pneumococci or mumps virus infections) may be prevented by immunization.\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  In adults,\na severe headache is the most common symptom of meningitis &ndash; occurring in\nalmost 90% of cases of bacterial meningitis, followed by nuchal rigidity\n(inability to flex the neck forward passively due to increased neck muscle tone\nand stiffness). The classic triad of diagnostic signs consists of nuchal\nrigidity, sudden high fever, and altered mental status; however, all three\nfeatures are present in less than half of all cases of bacterial meningitis.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Nuchal\nrigidity occurs in 70% of adult cases of bacterial meningitis. Other signs of\nmeningism include the presence of positive Kernig sign or Brudzinski sign.\nKernig sign is assessed with the patient lying supine, with the hip and knee\nflexed to 90 degrees. In a patient with a positive Kernig sign, pain limits\npassive extension of the knee. A positive Brudzinski's sign occurs when flexion\nof the neck causes involuntary flexion of the knee and hip. Although Kernig and\nBrudzinski signs are both commonly used to screen for meningitis, the\nsensitivity of these tests is limited. They do, however, have very good\nspecificity for meningitis: the signs rarely occur in other diseases.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Meningitis\ncaused by the bacterium\n  <i>\n   Neisseria meningitidis\n  </i>\n  (known as &ldquo;meningococcal\nmeningitis&rdquo;) can be differentiated from meningitis with other causes by a\nrapidly spreading petechial rash which may precede other symptoms. The rash\nconsists of numerous small, irregular purple or red spots (&ldquo;petechiae&rdquo;) on the\ntrunk, lower extremities, mucous membranes, conjuctiva, and (occasionally) the\npalms of the hands or soles of the feet. The rash is typically non-blanching:\nthe redness does not disappear when pressed with a finger or a glass tumbler.\nAlthough this rash is not necessarily present in meningococcal meningitis, it\nis relatively specific for the disease.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The types of bacteria that\ncause bacterial meningitis vary by age group. In premature babies and newborns\nup to three months old, common causes are\n <i>\n  group B streptococci\n </i>\n (which\nnormally inhabit the vagina and are mainly a cause during the first week of\nlife) and those that normally inhabit the digestive tract such as\n <i>\n  Escherichia\ncoli\n </i>\n (carrying K1 antigen).\n <i>\n  Listeria monocytogenes\n </i>\n may affect the\nnewborn and occurs in epidemics. Older children are more commonly affected by\n <i>\n  Neisseria\nmeningitidis\n </i>\n (meningococcus),\n <i>\n  Streptococcus pneumoniae\n </i>\n (serotypes 6,\n9, 14, 18 and 23) and those under five by\n <i>\n  Haemophilus influenzae\n </i>\n type B\n(mainly in countries that do not offer vaccination). In adults,\n <i>\n  N.\nmeningitidis\n </i>\n and\n <i>\n  S. pneumoniae\n </i>\n together cause 80% of all cases of\nbacterial meningitis, with increased risk of\n <i>\n  L. monocytogenes\n </i>\n in those\nover 50 years old. Since the pneumococcal vaccine was introduced, however,\nrates of pneumococcal meningitis have declined in children and adults.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Recent trauma to the skull\ngives bacteria in the nasal cavity the potential to enter the meningeal space.\nSimilarly, individuals with a cerebral shunt or related device are at increased\nrisk of infection through those devices. In these cases, infections with\nstaphylococci are more likely, as well as infections by pseudomonas and other\nGram-negative bacilli. The same pathogens are also more common in those with an\nimpaired immune system. In some people, an infection in the head and neck area,\nsuch as otitis media or mastoiditis, can lead to meningitis. Tuberculous\nmeningitis, meningitis due to infection with\n <i>\n  Mycobacterium tuberculosis\n </i>\n ,\nis more common in those from countries where tuberculosis is common, but is\nalso encountered in those with immune problems, such as AIDS.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n A literature review of 363\nreported cases of\n <i>\n  recurrent\n </i>\n meningitis showed that 59% of cases are due\nto anatomical abnormalities, 36% due to immune deficiencies (such as complement\ndeficiency, which predisposes especially to recurrent meningococcal\nmeningitis), and 5% due to ongoing infections in areas adjacent to the\nmeninges.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The term\n <i>\n  aseptic\nmeningitis\n </i>\n refers loosely to all cases of meningitis in which no bacterial\ninfection can be demonstrated. This is usually due to viruses, but it may be\ndue to bacterial infection that has already been partially treated, with\ndisappearance of the bacteria from the meninges, or by infection in a space\nadjacent to the meninges (e.g. sinusitis). Endocarditis (infection of the heart\nvalves with spread of small clusters of bacteria through the bloodstream) may\ncause aseptic meningitis. Aseptic meningitis may also result from infection\nwith spirochetes, a type of bacteria that includes\n <i>\n  Treponema pallidum\n </i>\n (the cause of syphilis) and\n <i>\n  Borrelia burgdorferi\n </i>\n (known for causing Lyme\ndisease). Meningitis may be encountered in cerebral malaria (malaria infecting\nthe brain). Fungal meningitis, e.g. due to\n <i>\n  Cryptococcus neoformans\n </i>\n , is\ntypically seen in people with immune deficiency such as AIDS.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Meningitis may occur as the\nresult of several non-infectious causes: spread of cancer to the meninges (\n <i>\n  malignant\nmeningitis\n </i>\n ) and certain drugs (mainly non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\nand antibiotics). It may also be caused by several inflammatory conditions such\nas sarcoidosis (which is then called neurosarcoidosis), connective tissue\ndisorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus, and certain forms of vasculitis\nsuch as Beh&ccedil;et's disease.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The most important test in\nidentifying or ruling out meningitis is analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid\nthrough lumbar puncture (LP, spinal tap). However, lumbar puncture is\ncontraindicated if there is a mass in the brain or the intracranial pressure\n(ICP) is elevated, as it may lead to brain herniation. If someone is at risk\nfor either a mass or raised ICP (recent head injury, a known immune system\nproblem, localizing neurological signs, or evidence on examination of a raised\nICP), a CT or MRI scan is recommended prior to the lumbar puncture. If a CT or\nMRI is required before LP, or if LP proves difficult, professional guidelines\nsuggest that antibiotics should be administered first to prevent delay in\ntreatment, especially if this may be longer than 30&nbsp;minutes.\n</p>\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n <table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" class=\"\">\n  <tr>\n   <td colspan=\"4\" width=\"390\">\n    <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n     <span>\n      &nbsp;\n     </span>\n    </p>\n    <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n     <b>\n      <span>\n       CSF Findings in Meningitis\n      </span>\n     </b>\n    </p>\n    <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n     <span>\n      &nbsp;\n     </span>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td colspan=\"4\" width=\"390\">\n    <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n     <span>\n      &nbsp;\n     </span>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>\n    <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n     <b>\n      <span>\n       Type of\n      </span>\n     </b>\n    </p>\n    <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n     <b>\n      <span>\n       meningitis\n      </span>\n     </b>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n   <td>\n    <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n     <b>\n      <span>\n       Glucose\n      </span>\n     </b>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n   <td>\n    <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n     <b>\n      <span>\n       Protein\n      </span>\n     </b>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n   <td width=\"170\">\n    <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n     <b>\n      <span>\n       Cells\n      </span>\n     </b>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>\n    <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n     <b>\n      <span>\n       &nbsp;\n      </span>\n     </b>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n   <td>\n    <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n     <b>\n      <span>\n       &nbsp;\n      </span>\n     </b>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n   <td>\n    <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n     <b>\n      <span>\n       &nbsp;\n      </span>\n     </b>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n   <td width=\"170\">\n    <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n     <b>\n      <span>\n       &nbsp;\n      </span>\n     </b>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>\n    <p class=\"\">\n     <b>\n      <span>\n       Acute\n  bacterial\n      </span>\n     </b>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n   <td>\n    <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n     <span>\n      low\n     </span>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n   <td>\n    <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n     <span>\n      high\n     </span>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n   <td width=\"170\">\n    <p class=\"\">\n     <span>\n      Neutrophils\n  predominate;\n     </span>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"\">\n     <span>\n      WBCs\n  &gt; 500/mm&sup3;\n     </span>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>\n    <p class=\"\">\n     <b>\n      <span>\n       Acute\n  viral\n      </span>\n     </b>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n   <td>\n    <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n     <span>\n      normal\n     </span>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n   <td>\n    <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n     <span>\n      normal or high\n     </span>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n   <td width=\"170\">\n    <p class=\"\">\n     <span>\n      Lymphocytes\n  predominate;\n     </span>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"\">\n     <span>\n      WBCs\n  &lt; 100/mm&sup3;\n     </span>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>\n    <p class=\"\">\n     <b>\n      <span>\n       Tuberculous\n      </span>\n     </b>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n   <td>\n    <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n     <span>\n      low\n     </span>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n   <td>\n    <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n     <span>\n      high\n     </span>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n   <td width=\"170\">\n    <p class=\"\">\n     <span>\n      Lymphocytes\n  predominate;\n     </span>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"\">\n     <span>\n      WBC\n  count variable\n     </span>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>\n    <p class=\"\">\n     <b>\n      <span>\n       Fungal\n      </span>\n     </b>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n   <td>\n    <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n     <span>\n      low\n     </span>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n   <td>\n    <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n     <span>\n      high\n     </span>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n   <td width=\"170\">\n    <p class=\"\">\n     <span>\n      Lymphocytes\n  predominate;\n     </span>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"\">\n     <span>\n      WBC\n  count variable\n     </span>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n </table>\n</div>\n", "question": "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  An\n18-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of fever, a\npoorly localized headache, and a stiff neck for 12 hours.

The early clinical presentation is\nnonspecific. Initial symptoms include fever, severe headache, nausea, vomiting,\nand muscle pain. Later signs and symptoms include maculopapular rash, petechial\nrash, abdominal pain, and joint pain.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The classic triad of\nfindings is fever, rash, and history of tick bite; however, this combination is\noften not identified when the patient presents initially. The rash has a\ncentripetal pattern of spread, meaning it begins at the extremities and courses\ntoward the trunk.\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n <span>\n  <img alt=\"Description: RMSF\" border=\"0\" height=\"139\" id=\"Picture 347194\" src=\"static/img/tutorials/image133.png\" width=\"217\"/>\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The rash first appears after\nthe onset of fever and is often subtle. Most often it begins as small, flat,\npink, non-itchy spots (macules) on the wrists, forearms, and ankles. These turn\npale when pressure is applied and eventually become raised. The characteristic\nred, spotted, petechial rash is usually not seen until the sixth day or later,\nbut this type of rash occurs in less than 60% of patients. The rash involves\nthe palms or soles in as many as 50% to 80%; however, this distribution may not\noccur until later in the course of the disease. 10-15% may never develop a\nrash.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Abnormal laboratory findings\ninclude thrombocytopenia and elevated liver enzyme levels. The disease can be\nvery severe, and patients often require hospitalization.\n <i>\n  R. rickettsii\n </i>\n can infect endothelial cells throughout the body, causing dysfunction of the\nrespiratory, gastrointestinal, renal, and neurologic systems. Diagnostic tests\ninclude IFA on blood samples, immunostaining of biopsy of the rash, or PCR on\nblood and skin biopsies.&nbsp; Appropriate antibiotic treatment should be\ninitiated\n <span>\n  immediately.\n </span>\n Doxycycline is the treatment of choice.\n(Failure to respond to a tetracycline antibiotic argues against a diagnosis of\nRocky Mountain spotted fever.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <b>\n  Lyme disease\n </b>\n is the\nmost common tick-borne disease in the Northern Hemisphere.&nbsp; It is named\nafter the town of Lyme, Connecticut, where a number of cases were identified in\n1975. Lyme disease is caused by spirochetes belonging to the genus\n <i>\n  Borrelia\n </i>\n .\nMost cases are caused by\n <i>\n  Borrelia burgdorferi.\n </i>\n <i>\n  Borrelia\n </i>\n is\ntransmitted to humans by the bite of infected ticks belonging to the genus\n <i>\n  Ixodes\n </i>\n (&ldquo;hard ticks&rdquo;).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Lyme disease can produce a\nrange of symptoms. The incubation period is usually one to two weeks, but can\nbe shorter (days) or longer (months to years). The disease usually occurs\nduring tick season (May to September). Asymptomatic infection occurs in less\nthan 7% of infected individuals. Early symptoms include fever, malaise,\nheadache, and muscle soreness. A classic sign is a circular, outwardly\nexpanding rash, called erythema chronicum migrans. It appears at the site of\nthe tick bite within a month of the bite. The rash is red, may be warm, and is\ngenerally painless. Classically, the innermost part is dark red and indurated\n(firm), the outer edge remains red, and the portion in between clears. This\ngives the lesion the appearance of a bullseye (see figure). Erythema chronicum\nmigrans is thought to occur in 80% of infected patients.\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n <span>\n  <img alt=\"Description: lyme-disease-rash\" border=\"0\" height=\"190\" id=\"Picture 347193\" src=\"static/img/tutorials/image134.png\" width=\"161\"/>\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Days to weeks after\ninfection, the bacteria may spread through the bloodstream. Symptoms of early\ndissemination include migrating pain in the muscles, joints, and tendons, and\nheart palpitations due to arrhythmia. Various neurological problems may occur,\nincluding facial palsy, meningitis, and encephalitis (resulting in memory loss,\nsleep disturbance, or mood change). After several months, untreated patients\nmay go on to develop chronic symptoms that affect the brain, nerves, eyes,\njoints, and heart.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The diagnosis of Lyme\ndisease is based on symptoms, objective physical findings (such as erythema\nmigrans, facial palsy, or arthritis), history of possible exposure to infected\nticks, and serological blood tests.

Cough, vomiting, arthralgias, neurologic symptoms (e.g.\naltered sensorium and neck stiffness) also occur, but rash is uncommon.\nLaboratory abnormalities include leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated\nhepatic transaminase levels. The estimated death rate is 1% to 10%;\nhospitalization rates are as high as 60%.

The disease affects a variety of wild animals,\nincluding rabbits, deer, squirrels, muskrat, and beaver. Humans can acquire the\nbacteria from direct contact with these animals, from the bite of a tick or fly\nthat has fed on an infected animal, or from contaminated food or water.\nTularemia usually occurs in the summer months and is most common in people who\nhave had contact with infected animals (e.g. hunters, furriers, butchers,\nlaboratory workers, game wardens, and veterinarians). In the U.S., most cases\noccur in the southeastern and Rocky Mountain states. The primary vectors are\nticks and deer flies.&nbsp; This organism is also listed on the CDC&rsquo;s list of\ncategory A biological weapons.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The incubation period is\n1-14 days. Symptoms include fever, chills, malaise, anorexia, rash, and\nenlarged lymph nodes. There are five characteristic clinical syndromes:\nulceroglandular/glandular (the most common type, representing 75% of all\nforms), oropharyngeal, pneumonic, oculoglandular, and typhoidal. In\nulceroglandular fever, a tender red bump appears in the area of the tick bite.\nWithin a few weeks, the bump ulcerates. Nearby lymph nodes swell enormously,\nbecome very tender, and may drain purulent fluid (see figure).

The disease is transmitted via airborne\ndroplets from the upper respiratory tract and is usually mild, lasting 1-3\ndays. Children recover more quickly than adults. Infection of the mother during\npregnancy can be serious; if the mother is infected within the first 20 weeks\nof pregnancy, the child may be born with congenital rubella syndrome\n(CRS).&nbsp;\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The primary finding is rash\non the face that spreads to the trunk and limbs, and usually fades after three\ndays (hence, the term &ldquo;three-day measles&rdquo;). Other symptoms include fever,\nlymphadenopathy, joint pains, headache, and conjunctivitis. The fever rarely\nrises above 38\n <sup>\n  o\n </sup>\n C (100.4\n <sup>\n  o\n </sup>\n F), and the rash (usually\nitchy) is pink or light red.

It commonly\ncauses chickenpox in children and zoster (shingles) in adults. Primary\ninfection results in chickenpox (varicella), a highly contagious disease spread\nby coughing and sneezing and by direct contact with fluid from infected\nvesicles on the skin.&nbsp;\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Initial symptoms may include\nfever, malaise, headache, sore throat, myalgia, and itching. The chicken pox\nrash begins on the face and trunk and spreads to the extremities. Lesions start\nas 2-4 mm erythematous papules that develop an irregular outline (rose petal).\nA thin-walled, clear vesicle (dew drop) develops on top of the erythematous\narea. This &ldquo;dew drop on a rose petal&rdquo; is characteristic of chicken pox. After\n8-12 hours, the fluid gets cloudy and the vesicle breaks, leaving a crust. The\nfluid is highly contagious, but once the lesions crust over, the patient is no\nlonger infectious. The crust usually falls off after 7 days. Each lesion goes\nthrough this cycle in about 7 days, and new lesions crop up daily. Rare complications\ninclude pneumonia and encephalitis.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n When clinical symptoms have\nresolved, VZV remains dormant in the nervous system, particularly in the\ntrigeminal and dorsal root ganglia. In about 10&ndash;20% of cases, the virus\nreactivates later in life causing shingles. Shingles usually presents with pain\nand vesicular rash in a dermatomal distribution. Complications include\npostherpetic neuralgia (severe pain in the distribution of the affected\nnerve).&nbsp; The rash described in the vignette is typical of chickenpox,\nwhich is caused by the varicella-zoster virus.\n</p>\n", "question": "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  A\n4-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a 2-day history of fever\nand an itchy rash.

The envelope is\nrelatively sensitive to detergents and is needed to aid in attachment of the\nvirus to the host cell. Loss of the envelope results in loss of infectivity.\nEnveloped viruses are easily inactivated by routine surface cleaning and\ndisinfection. HIV-1 has an envelope; hepatitis A virus does not.

The envelope is usually derived from portions\nof the host cell membrane (which is comprised of phospholipids and proteins),\nbut also includes virally derived glycoproteins. Functionally, the envelope is\nused by viruses to enter the host cell. Glycoproteins on the surface of the\nenvelope bind to receptor sites on the host&rsquo;s membrane. The viral envelope then\nfuses with the host&rsquo;s membrane, allowing the capsid and viral genome to enter\nthe host.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The viral envelope, which is\ncomposed of a lipid bilayer, is relatively sensitive to desiccation, heat, and\ndetergents. Consequently, enveloped viruses are easier to sterilize than\nnon-enveloped viruses.

Timing and acuity of\nonset, exacerbating and alleviating factors, and degree of functional\nimpairment are key elements of the history. Associated symptoms such as cough,\nhemoptysis, chest pain, wheezing, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea,\nas well as environmental triggers, should be elicited and are helpful in\ndeveloping a differential diagnosis. If dyspnea is recent, of sudden onset, and\naccompanied by chest pain, then diseases such as pneumothorax, pulmonary\nembolism, and pulmonary edema should come to mind. If the dyspnea is\nlong-standing and is slowly progressive, then chronic conditions such as\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary\narterial hypertension, and neuromuscular disorders are in the differential\ndiagnosis. The progression of chronic dyspnea may be insidious. Asking specific\nquestions to quantify changes in functional status over time is important.\nDyspnea may occur during exertion or at rest and may be episodic or continuous.\nEpisodic dyspnea associated with exertion suggests parenchymal lung disease or\ncardiac dysfunction. Dyspnea that is seasonal or triggered by environmental\nexposure suggests diseases such as asthma and hypersensitivity pneumonitis.\nPositional dyspnea can occur in patients with severe obstructive lung disease,\ndiaphragmatic paralysis, or neuromuscular weakness.\n </span>\n</p>\n"}, {"answer": "<p class=\"\">\n <b>\n  <span>\n   Answer\n  </span>\n </b>\n <b>\n  <span>\n   B is correct.\n  </span>\n </b>\n <span>\n  The patient&rsquo;s asthma is\nclassified as &ldquo;mild persistent&rdquo; based on frequency of symptoms (daytime and\nnighttime), as well as the FEV1.

Symptoms can\nbe prevented by avoiding triggers, such as allergens and irritants, and by\nusing &ldquo;controller&rdquo; medicines, such as inhaled corticosteroids and oral\nleukotriene antagonists.\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  The\nclinical classification of asthma in adults appears below.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"\">\n <tr>\n  <td colspan=\"4\" valign=\"top\" width=\"469\">\n   <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     &nbsp;\n    </span>\n   </p>\n   <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Classification of Asthma by Severity in Adults\n    </span>\n   </p>\n   <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     &nbsp;\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"107\">\n   <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Severity\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"114\">\n   <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Symptom frequency (daytime)\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"135\">\n   <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Symptom frequency\n    </span>\n   </p>\n   <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     (nighttime)\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"112\">\n   <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     FEV\n     <sub>\n      1\n     </sub>\n    </span>\n   </p>\n   <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     (% of predicted)\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"107\">\n   <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     &nbsp;\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"114\">\n   <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     &nbsp;\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"135\">\n   <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     &nbsp;\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"112\">\n   <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     &nbsp;\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td valign=\"top\">\n   <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Intermittent\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"114\">\n   <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     &le;2 per week\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"135\">\n   <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     &le;2 per month\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"112\">\n   <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     &ge;80%\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td valign=\"top\">\n   <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Mild persistent\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"114\">\n   <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     &gt;2 per week,\n     <br/>\n     but not daily\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"135\">\n   <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     3-4 per month\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"112\">\n   <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     &ge;80%\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td valign=\"top\">\n   <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Moderate persistent\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"114\">\n   <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Daily\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"135\">\n   <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     &gt;1 per week but not nightly\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"112\">\n   <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     60&ndash;80%\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td valign=\"top\">\n   <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Severe persistent\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"114\">\n   <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Throughout the day\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"135\">\n   <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Frequent (often 7x/week)\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"112\">\n   <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     &lt;60%\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n</table>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  FEV1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

This gene is\nrequired to regulate the components of mucus, sweat, and digestive juices. The\ndisease affects several different organs, but most morbidity and mortality is\nrelated to pulmonary infections. Pancreatic insufficiency is also a common\ncause of morbidity. The hallmark symptoms are salty-tasting skin; poor growth\ndespite normal food intake; accumulation of thick, sticky mucus; recurrent\nsinus infections; frequent chest infections with coughing and shortness of\nbreath; and diarrhea. Males may be infertile because of congenital absence of\nthe vas deferens. Symptoms often appear in infancy and childhood. Bowel obstruction\ndue to meconium ileus occurs in newborn babies. As the child grows, he or she\nmust struggle to expectorate thick mucus. (Ciliated epithelial cells have a\nmutated protein that results in abnormally viscous mucus production.) Poor\ngrowth in children is the result of chronic lung infection, poor absorption of\nnutrients through the gastrointestinal tract, and increased metabolic demand\ndue to chronic illness.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <i>\n  Primary ciliary\ndyskinesia\n </i>\n (\n <i>\n  <span>\n   PCD\n  </span>\n </i>\n ), also known as\n <span>\n  immotile ciliary\nsyndrome\n </span>\n or\n <span>\n  Kartagener&rsquo;s Syndrome,\n </span>\n is a rare, autosomal\nrecessive disorder characterized by impaired ciliary action along the lining of\nthe respiratory tract and fallopian tubes.

In\nPCD, ciliary dysfunction results in impaired mucus clearance, which predisposes\nthe patient to sinusitis, bronchitis, otitis media, bronchiectasis, and\npneumonia. Infertility is common because of defective ciliary action in the\nfallopian tubes and diminished sperm motility. 50% of individuals with PCD\ndevelop situs inversus, where the laterality of the internal organs is the\nmirror-image of normal.

It may be associated with various types of cyanotic heart\ndisease (e.g., transposition of the great arteries), and it is the most common\ncardiovascular defect in Turner syndrome. Tests can distinguish among the\npossible causes of coarctation. A bicuspid aortic valve will present with an ejection\nclick in the aortic area. A patent ductus arteriosus produces a continuous,\nmachine-like murmur in left infra-clavicular and left scapular area.\n  <span>\n   A\nventricular septal defect produces a holosystolic murmur.

It is a dynamic quantity and not a distinct, measurable\ncompartment. The concept of ECV is useful for understanding cardiovascular and\nrenal physiology. Although ECV normally varies with extracellular fluid (ECF),\nthe two become uncoupled in disorders like congestive heart failure and\ncirrhosis. In these conditions, the kidney responds as if the body were truly\nhypovolemic.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n There are several volume and\npressure sensing systems that influence ECF and ECV. If they contract then\nvolume preserving systems become active, and if they expand then volume\ndepletion systems become active. Volume sensors, also known as low pressure\nbaroreceptors, are located in the atria, right ventricle, and large pulmonary\nvessels. They become active when the blood volume increases; in essence they\nsense fullness of the vascular system. When active, these volume sensors send\nneural activity to the brainstem via the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves,\nresulting in decreases in sympathetic nerve activity and antidiuretic hormone\n(ADH) secretion; these effects will enhance the excretion of sodium and water.\nAtrial and ventricular cells also secrete atrial natriuretic peptide and brain\nnatriuretic peptide, respectively, when volume is high, resulting in sodium and\nwater excretion and reduction of ADH secretion.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n High pressure baroreceptors\nare located in the carotid sinus, aortic arch, and the juxtaglomerular (JG)\napparatus of the kidneys. The baroreceptor reflex increases sympathetic\nactivity to the vasculature if blood pressure decreases and vice versa to\nincrease or decrease vascular tone, respectively, to control blood pressure. In\naddition, changes in sympathetic activity alter excretion of sodium and water.\nIncreasing sympathetic activity directly increases renin secretion from\njuxtaglomerular cells; the resultant increase in angiotensin II produces\nvasoconstriction, and the secretion of aldosterone elicited by angiotensin II\nenhances salt and water reabsorption by the kidneys. JG cells directly detect\nthe lower perfusion pressure that occurs when blood pressure decreases and\nrespond by secreting renin. Glomerular filtration rate also decreases with\nlower perfusion pressure and the resultant sympathetic-mediated constriction of\nafferent and efferent arterioles which reduces delivery of NaCl to the macula\ndensa, and this process (tubuloglomerular feedback) also enhances renin\nsecretion.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Hepatic cirrhosis is\nassociated with decreased albumin in plasma, which results in edema due to a\nreduction in plasma oncotic pressure. Edema reduces ECV which the pressure and\nvolume sensors interpret as a contraction (reduction) of ECV. Thus, volume\nconserving mechanisms become active. The net effect is relatively more\nconservation of water than salt, resulting in hyponatremia.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Congestive heart failure\ncauses a reduction in cardiac output and thus ECV. The resultant decrease in\nblood pressure activates volume conserving systems which overfill the vascular\nsystem, causing jugular venous distension, pulmonary crackles, edema, and\nabnormal cardiac findings.\n</p>\n", "question": "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  A\n56-year-old man presents with mild confusion and abdominal swelling.

Most primary\nlung cancers are\n <span>\n  carcinomas\n </span>\n . Prolonged exposure to tobacco is the\nmost common etiology. In nonsmokers, lung cancer is often attributed to genetic\nfactors, radon gas, asbestos, and air pollution (including secondhand smoke).\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  The two\nmain types of lung cancer are\n  <span>\n   small cell\n  </span>\n  and\n  <span>\n   non-small cell\n  </span>\n  .\nThe distinction is important because treatment varies: non-small cell lung\ncancer (NSCLC) is sometimes treated with surgery; small cell lung cancer (SCLC)\nresponds better to chemotherapy and radiation.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Non-small\ncell lung cancers are grouped together because their prognosis and management\nare similar. The main types of non-small cell lung cancer are squamous cell\ncarcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and large cell carcinoma. Squamous cell carcinoma\nusually starts near a central bronchus. Cavitation and necrosis are common.\nAdenocarcinoma usually originates in the lung periphery. Although most cases\noccur in smokers, this is the principal histological type seen in non-smokers.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Small cell\ncancer is less common than non-small cell cancer. Formerly known as \"oat\ncell\" carcinoma, small cell cancer usually arises in the large airways,\nand grows rapidly. Despite being more sensitive to chemotherapy and radiation\nthan other histologic types, small cell cancer is often metastatic at\npresentation and carries a worse prognosis. It is strongly associated with\nsmoking. The cancer cells contain dense neurosecretory vesicles, which contain\nneuroendocrine hormones. These hormones are responsible for paraneoplastic\nsyndromes.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<table align=\"left\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" class=\"\">\n <tr>\n  <td>\n   <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n

Unlike lung cancer, there is no association\nbetween mesothelioma and smoking. Symptoms include shortness of breath due to\npleural effusion, chest wall pain, and general symptoms such as weight loss.\nX-ray may reveal pleural thickening, commonly seen after asbestos exposure.

One or more cavities may be\npresent. If the lesion is single, abscess from necrotizing Gram-negative or\nstaphylococcal pneumonia should be a primary consideration, especially if the\npatient is acutely ill with severe pneumonia. If multiple cavities are present,\nthe infection is likely due to hematogenous dissemination (septic emboli), and\na source for this dissemination should be sought (e.g., right-sided\nendocarditis).\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Lung\nabscesses secondary to aspiration are frequently right-sided and most often\ninvolve the lower lobe.* Most patients with anaerobic lung abscess have risk\nfactors for aspiration, such as poor dental hygiene, seizure disorder, or\nalcoholic blackouts. The manifestation is often indolent, with complaints of\ncough, fever, and malaise lasting weeks to months.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Tubercular\ncavities are usually located in the upper zone, either the posterior segment of\nthe upper lobe or apical segment of the lower lobe. Because of the high\nconcentration of tuberculous bacilli in the cavity, patients usually have a\nsputum smear that is strongly positive for acid-fast bacilli.&nbsp;\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  A\nvariety of fungi can cause cavitary lesions.\n  <i>\n   Aspergillus, Mucor\n  </i>\n  , and\n  <i>\n   Candida\n  </i>\n  rarely cause disease in normal hosts. The endemic fungi (histoplasma,\nblastomyces, and coccidiodes), however, can produce cavitary lesions in\nimmunocompetent hosts. These organisms should be considered if travel to an\nendemic area has occurred.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Pulmonary\nlesions due to infected bullae/cysts are thin-walled cavities with smooth\noutline. Thick-walled cavities may result from pulmonary vasculitis, of which\nWegener&rsquo;s granulomatosis is the prototype. Wegener&rsquo;s granulomatosis often\nresults in bilateral cavitary lesions. Pulmonary embolism with infarction is a\nrare cause of lung cavitation. Neoplasia, either primary (bronchogenic\ncarcinoma, lymphoma) or metastatic (from squamous cell) can produce cavities.\nThese are usually thick-walled.

The fundamental abnormality\nis insufficient pulmonary surfactant produced by type II pneumocytes. This\nresults in failure of the lungs to expand after birth. RDS is characterized by\nhyaline membranes, which consist of underdeveloped epithelial cells and plasma\nproteins lining the airways. The condition can be ameliorated by prophylactic\nadministration of steroids, surfactant therapy, and by improved ventilation\ntechniques.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"row\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\"row text-center\"><h4>Tutorial</h4></div>\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  There are\nmany causes of respiratory distress in the newborn, including sepsis,\npneumonia, excessive sedation of the mother, fetal head injury during delivery,\naspiration of blood or amniotic fluid, and perinatal depression or intrauterine\nhypoxia brought about by a number of reasons including coiling of the umbilical\ncord about the neck (nuchal cord). However, the most common cause is\nrespiratory distress syndrome (RDS), also known as\n  <span>\n   hyaline membrane\ndisease\n  </span>\n  because of the formation of &ldquo;membranes&rdquo; in the peripheral air\nspaces of infants who succumb to this condition.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  RDS is\nbasically a disease of premature infants\n  <i>\n   .\n  </i>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Other contributing influences are\n  <span>\n   maternal\ndiabetes, cesarean section\n  </span>\n  before the onset of labor, and\n  <span>\n   twin\ngestation.\n  </span>\n  The fundamental defect in RDS is the inability of the immature\nlung to synthesize sufficient surfactant. Surfactant is a complex of\nsurface-active phospholipids, principally dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine\n(lecithin), and at least two groups of surfactant-associated proteins. Surfactant\nis synthesized by type II pneumocytes. With the healthy newborn&rsquo;s first breath,\nit rapidly coats the surface of alveoli, reducing surface tension and\ndecreasing the pressure required to keep alveoli open. In a lung deficient in\nsurfactant, alveoli tend to collapse, and a relatively greater inspiratory\neffort is required with each breath to open the alveoli. Thus, surface tension\nis increased and lung compliance is decreased. The infant rapidly tires from\nbreathing, and generalized atelectasis sets in. The resulting hypoxia sets into\nmotion a sequence of events that lead to epithelial and endothelial damage and\neventually to the formation of hyaline membranes.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n RDS begins shortly after\nbirth and is manifested by tachypnea, tachycardia, chest wall retractions\n(recession), expiratory grunting, nasal flaring, and cyanosis during breathing\nefforts. As the disease progresses, the baby may develop ventilatory failure\n(rising carbon dioxide levels in the blood), and prolonged cessations of\nbreathing (apnea). Findings include hypotension and acidosis. Radiographic\nfindings include low lung volumes, diffuse reticulogranular pattern\n(homogeneous ground-glass appearance) due to diffuse alveolar atelectasis and\nair bronchograms due to alveolar collapse. The disorder may be associated with\nother conditions that accompany prematurity, such as\n <span>\n  patent ductus\narteriosus, intraventricular hemorrhage,\n </span>\n and\n <span>\n  necrotizing\nenterocolitis.\n </span>\n The clinical course for the acute disease lasts about 2\nto 3 days. During the first day, the patient worsens and requires more support.\nDuring the second day, the baby may be remarkably stable on adequate support.\nResolution is noted during the third day, heralded by a prompt diuresis.\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <a name=\"4-u1.0-B978-1-4160-2973-1..50010-7--f22\">\n </a>\n <a name=\"4-u1.0-B978-1-4160-2973-1..50010-7--cese\">\n </a>\n <span>\n  A major thrust in the control of RDS focuses on\nprevention, either by delaying labor until the fetal lung reaches maturity or\nby inducing maturation of the lung in the fetus at risk. Critical to these\nobjectives is the ability to assess fetal lung maturity accurately. Because\npulmonary secretions are discharged into the amniotic fluid, analysis of\namniotic fluid phospholipids provides a good estimate of the level of\nsurfactant in the alveolar lining. Prophylactic administration of exogenous\nsurfactant at birth to extremely premature infants (gestational age &lt;28 weeks)\nhas been shown to be very beneficial, such that it is now uncommon for infants\nto die of acute RDS.&nbsp; The introduction of antenatal steroids has also\ndecreased the incidence of RDS by as much as 50% in premature infants.&nbsp;\n </span>\n</p>\n", "question": "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  A\n4-hour-old female newborn delivered at 30 weeks&rsquo; gestation has respiratory\ndistress.

The peripheral vasoconstriction is caused by both\nactivation of vasoconstrictor pathways (renin-angiotensin and sympathetic\nnervous systems) and inhibition of vasodilator pathways (nitric oxide).

Renal artery stenosis leads to\nunderperfusion of the juxtaglomerular cells, thereby producing renin-dependent\nhypertension. The following clinical clues increase the suspicion of\nrenovascular hypertension: any hospitalization for urgent or emergent\nhypertension; recurrent &ldquo;flash&rdquo; pulmonary edema; recent worsening of\nlong-standing, previously well controlled hypertension; severe hypertension in\na young woman or in an older adult after the age of 50 years; precipitous and\nprogressive worsening of renal function in response to angiotensin-converting\nenzyme (ACE) inhibition or angiotensin II receptor blockade; unilateral small\nkidney; extensive peripheral arteriosclerosis; and a flank bruit.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <u>\n  <span>\n   Coarctation\nof the aorta\n  </span>\n </u>\n <span>\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Coarctation\nof the aorta typically occurs just distal to the origin of the left subclavian\nartery, so the blood pressure is lower in the legs than in the arms (opposite\nof the normal situation)\n  <a name=\"4-u1.0-B978-1-4160-2805-5..50071-9--intr\">\n  </a>\n  .\nThe clue is that pulses are weaker in the lower than in the upper extremities,\nindicating the need to measure blood pressure in the legs as well as in both\narms.

Cushing's disease refers to one\nspecific cause of the syndrome, a tumor (adenoma) in the pituitary gland that\nproduces large amounts of ACTH, which in turn elevates cortisol.

More typically, patients are first seen\nbecause of jaundice and fatigue. Abnormalities in routine liver test results\nare also similar to the abnormalities found in other forms of chronic hepatitis\nwith elevations in serum aminotransferase levels.

Ulcerative colitis is characterized by inflammation and ulceration\nconfined to the colonic mucosa. Crohn&rsquo;s disease is manifested by transmural\ninflammation and granulomas affecting any segment of the GI tract, including\nthe colon. Ulcerative colitis invariably involves the rectum and extends\nproximally without skipping segments. Crohn&rsquo;s disease causes discontinuous,\npatchy inflammation of the GI tract, usually involving the small bowel, ileum,\nand colon. N\n </span>\n <span>\n  ewly\ndiagnosed IBD has its peak incidence in the second decade of life, with the\nvast majority of new cases occurring in people aged 15-40 years.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Crohn&rsquo;s disease is an\nidiopathic, chronic, transmural inflammatory process of the bowel that often\nleads to fibrosis and obstructive symptoms and can affect any part of the gastrointestinal\ntract from the mouth to the anus. Approximately 30% of Crohn&rsquo;s disease cases\ninvolve the small bowel, particularly the terminal ileum, another 30% involve\nthe colon alone, and 40% involve both the small bowel and colon. The\ncharacteristic presentation of Crohn&rsquo;s disease is abdominal pain and diarrhea,\nwhich may be complicated by intestinal fistulization, obstruction, or both.\nAdditional findings may include malnutrition and bone demineralization.\nUnpredictable flares and remissions characterize the long-term course of this\ndisease. Microscopically, focal inflammatory infiltrates form around the\ncrypts. Ulceration of the superficial mucosa occurs and crypt abscesses\ndevelop. Later, inflammatory cells invade the deep mucosal layers and form noncaseating\ngranulomas. The granulomas extend through all layers of the intestinal wall and\ninto the mesentery and regional lymph nodes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Ulcerative colitis is a\nchronic, idiopathic condition characterized by inflammation of the colon.\nPatients typically have rectal bleeding, frequent stools, and mucous discharge\nwith or without tenesmus. Acute and chronic inflammation of the lamina propria,\ncrypt branching, and villous atrophy occur. There is discharge of mucus from\ngoblet cells. Ulcers appear and are soon covered by granulation tissue.\nExcessive fibrosis is not a feature of the disease.

Endometrial glands in these layers\nproliferate under the influence of estrogen in the follicular phase so that the\nmucosa thickens.

There are two types of PKD:\nautosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and the much less-common autosomal\nrecessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <b>\n  Autosomal dominant\npolycystic kidney disease.\n </b>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n ADPKD is the most common\nMendelian disorder of the kidneys. It occurs in one in 1000 people. Disease\npenetrance is 100%. Approximately 10% of individuals with end-stage renal\ndisease (ESRD) carry a diagnosis of ADPKD. 85% of cases are caused by a\nmutation in the\n <span>\n  PKD1\n </span>\n gene, and 15% of cases are caused by mutation\nin the\n <span>\n  PKD2\n </span>\n gene. Polycystin 1 and polycystin 2 are the protein\nproducts of PKD1 and PKD2.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n ADPKD usually presents\nbetween the ages of 30 and 40 and results in kidney failure by the fifth or\nsixth decade. The condition is characterized by focal development of renal and\nextrarenal cysts in an age-dependent manner, resulting in a slow, gradual, and massive\nkidney enlargement. Typically kidney function does not decline until kidney\nsize is at least five times greater than normal. As the cysts accumulate fluid,\nthey enlarge, separate entirely from the nephron, compress the neighboring\nrenal parenchyma, and progressively compromise renal function.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Findings in ADPKD may\ninclude hypertension, flank pain, palpable flank mass, hematuria, and urinary\nfrequency. Flank pain may be due to renal hemorrhage, passage of kidney stones,\nor urinary tract infection. Extrarenal manifestations include liver cysts,\npancreatic cysts, splenic cysts, central nervous system arachnoid cysts, and\ncerebral aneurysms. Individuals with ADPKD have an increased incidence of\ndiverticular disease and mitral valve prolapse.\n <a name=\"4-u1.0-B978-0-323-05611-3..00025-2--u974\">\n </a>\n <a name=\"4-u1.0-B978-0-323-05611-3..00025-2--s456\">\n </a>\n <a name=\"4-u1.0-B978-0-323-05611-3..00025-2--st48\">\n </a>\n <a name=\"4-u1.0-B978-0-323-05611-3..00025-2--l314\">\n </a>\n <a name=\"4-u1.0-B978-0-323-05611-3..00025-2--l315\">\n </a>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <b>\n  Autosomal recessive\npolycystic kidney disease\n </b>\n .\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The clinical presentation of\nARPKD is highly variable.

This reduces sodium absorption. Normally, sodium is absorbed and\ndelivered to the medullary interstitium, raising its osmolarity. By inhibiting\nsodium absorption, furosemide reduces the osmolarity of the medullary\ninterstitium. That osmolarity drives passive water absorption from the\ndescending limb of the loop. When the osmolarity of the interstitium is reduced\nafter administration of furosemide, sodium absorption in the descending limb is\nreduced as well.\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"row\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\"row text-center\"><h4>Tutorial</h4></div>\n<p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <img alt=\"Description: nephron\" border=\"0\" height=\"226\" id=\"Picture 347267\" src=\"static/img/tutorials/image168.png\" width=\"243\"/>\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The\n <span>\n  loop of Henle\n </span>\n is the portion of the nephron that extends from the proximal convoluted tubule\nto the distal convoluted tubule. The loop has a hairpin bend in the renal\nmedulla. Its main function is to create a concentration gradient in the\nmedulla. By means of a countercurrent multiplier system using sodium pumps, an\narea of high sodium concentration is created in the medulla. This increases the\ntonicity of the medulla. The hypertonic medulla then passively draws water from\nthe filtrate, concentrating the urine.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The loop of Henle consists\nof a descending and an ascending limb. The descending limb is permeable to\nwater. As the filtrate travels down the descending limb in the hypertonic\nmedulla, water flows out freely until the tonicity of the filtrate and\ninterstitium equilibrate. The thick ascending limb, by contrast, is impermeable\nto water. It actively absorbs sodium from the filtrate and delivers it to the\nmedullary interstitium, raising its tonicity. The hypertonic interstitium then\npassively draws water from the descending limb and collecting ducts.&nbsp;\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Cells in the thick ascending\nloop of Henle use the\n <span>\n  Na-K-2Cl\n  <b>\n  </b>\n  transporter\n </span>\n to reabsorb\nsodium. This transporter resides in the apical membrane of cells lining the\nthick ascending limb. (The apical membrane is on the luminal side). For each\nmolecule of sodium absorbed, a molecule of potassium and two molecules of\nchloride are also absorbed. Hence, the designation: Na-K-2Cl. (Na, K, and Cl\nare transported in the same direction, i.e., from the filtrate into the\ncell.)&nbsp;\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Furosemide (Lasix) and other\nloop diuretics inhibit the Na-K-2Cl transporter in the thick ascending limb of\nthe loop of Henle. This impairs sodium absorption, which is needed to raise the\ntonicity of the medullary interstitium. By inhibiting sodium absorption,\nfurosemide decreases the tonicity (osmolarity) of the medullary interstitium.\nTonicity drives water absorption in the descending limb of the loop. By\ndecreased the tonicity of the medullary interstitium, furosemide decreases\nwater absorption in the descending limb.\n</p>\n", "question": "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  A\n66-year-old man is admitted to the hospital with shortness of breath and leg\nswelling.

(The omphalomesenteric duct is a long\nnarrow tube that joins the yolk sac to the midgut lumen of the developing\nfetus.

The majority of individuals are\nasymptomatic. The most common presenting symptom is painless rectal bleeding\n(typically melena). The bleeding usually occurs without warning and stops\nspontaneously. Some patients present with abdominal pain and distension due to\nintestinal obstruction, volvulus, or intussusception.&nbsp; The diagnosis is\nmade by a Meckle&rsquo;s Scan, which consists of intravenous infusion 99m technetium\npertechnetate, which has an affinity for gastric mucosa, and performing\nscintigraphy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Occasionally, the condition can mimic acute\nappendicitis or present as an indirect hernia (usually right-sided).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The diverticulum may be\nattached to the umbilical region by the vitelline ligament, with the\npossibility of vitelline cysts, or even a patent vitelline canal forming a\nvitelline fistula.

(Normally the intestines protrude from the abdomen\ninto the umbilical cord until about the tenth week of pregnancy, after which\nthey return to the abdomen.)

Also important, but less well characterized, is the\n    response of the bladder muscle to the increase in outlet resistance\n    provided by the combination of mechanical obstruction and increased\n    prostatic and bladder neck smooth muscle tone.

Secondary adrenal insufficiency is caused by hypothalamic or\npituitary dysfunction.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Primary adrenal\ninsufficiency is associated with inadequate secretion of glucocorticoid and\nmineralcorticoid hormones.

Skin\nhyperpigmentation, initially on the extensor surfaces, palmar creases, and\nbuccal mucosa, results from increased levels of ACTH.

As the Langerhans cells\nare transported to the lymph nodes, they differentiate into dendritic cells,\nwhich are immunostimulatory.

In fact, this mineralocorticoid receptor\nbinds cortisol 10 times more avidly than it binds aldosterone. The effect of\ncortisol, however, is eliminated by the enzyme 11&beta;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase\n2, which metabolizes cortisol to inactive cortisone. In states of excess\ncortisol, the enzymatic activity of 11&beta;-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 can\nbe overwhelmed such that bound cortisol is not metabolized and there is\nactivation of the mineralcorticoid receptor.

The term &ldquo;Cushing disease&rdquo; is reserved for Cushing syndrome\nthat is caused by excessive secretion of adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) by\na pituitary tumor, usually an adenoma.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Cushing\ndisease is responsible for roughly two-thirds of the cases of endogenous\nCushing syndrome. The remaining endogenous cases are caused by ectopic\nACTH-secreting tumors and primary adrenal neoplasms. Cushing disease occurs\nmost frequently in women of reproductive age, but it can affect males and\nfemales of any age.The pituitary tumors in Cushing disease are usually\nmicroadenomas, which, by definition, are 10 mm or less in diameter.\nMicroadenomas generally do not cause symptoms by local mass effect. These\ntumors are most often discovered when clinical manifestations of\nhypercortisolism resulting from hypersecretion of ACTH prompt an appropriate\ndiagnostic work-up. Occasionally, microadenomas are found incidentally during\nimaging performed for other reasons. Macroadenomas are uncommon in patients\nwith Cushing disease. These tumors cause mass effect when their size exceeds 15\nmm in diameter. Suprasellar extension and optic chiasm compression, local bone\nerosion, cavernous sinus compression, and panhypopituitarism may occur as a\nmacroadenoma enlarges.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Although\npituitary adenomas causing Cushing disease secrete excessive amounts of ACTH,\nthey generally retain some negative feedback responsiveness to high doses of\nglucocorticoids. Ectopic sources of ACTH, usually in the form of extracranial\nneoplasms, however, are generally not responsive to negative feedback with high\ndoses of glucocorticoids. A common effect of elevated ACTH levels (whatever the\nsource) is bilateral adrenocortical hyperplasia.\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  When\nCushing syndrome is suspected, initial laboratory testing is usually directed\nat confirming excessive glucocorticoid production. This is best accomplished\nthrough analysis of a 24-hour urine collection for urinary free cortisol\nexcretion. Values greater than 300 &mu;g/day are considered diagnostic for\nCushing syndrome.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Once\nhypersecretion of cortisol is confirmed, the next step is to determine whether\nthe pathologic state is ACTH-dependent or ACTH-independent. This can be\naccomplished through measurement of the late-afternoon ACTH level.\n(Late-afternoon (after 4 p.m.) timing is important because ACTH levels are\nnormally low at that time.) If the plasma ACTH level is &gt; 10 pg/mL, then the\nprocess is ACTH-dependent. If the ACTH level is &lt; 5 pg/mL, then the process\nis ACTH-independent.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  If the\nprocess is ACTH-dependent, a high-dose dexamethasone suppression test combined\nwith cranial MRI studies may aid in localizing the site of ACTH overproduction.\nIn an 8-mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test, a single 8-mg dose of\ndexamethasone is given at 11 p.m., and the serum cortisol level is measured at\n8 a.m. the next morning. Suppression of the cortisol level to less than 50% of\nbaseline is considered indicative of Cushing disease (pituitary microadenoma).\nFailure of dexamethasone to suppress cortisol levels to less than 50% of\nbaseline suggests an ectopic source of ACTH production (e.g. extracranial\nneoplasm).\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  The\npatient in this vignette has signs of Cushing syndrome: moon face, supraclavicular\nfat pads, violaceous striae, hypertension, weight gain, and osteopenia. A high\nurinary free cortisol level confirms the diagnosis of Cushing syndrome. The\nhigh ACTH level indicates that the disorder is ACTH-dependent. A positive\nhigh-dose dexamethasone test (suppression of serum cortisol to &lt; 50%\nbaseline) indicates that the patient most likely has Cushing disease (a\npituitary microadenoma secreting ACTH).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Excessive\nACTH production stimulates the adrenal glands to produce excessive cortisol. Free\ncortisol passes easily through cellular membranes, where it binds to the\nglucocorticoid receptor. The glucocorticoid receptor is expressed in almost\nevery cell in the body and regulates genes controlling the development,\nmetabolism, and immune response. Aldosterone, which is regulated mainly through\nthe renin-angiotensin system, also passes easily through cellular membranes. It\nacts on mineralocorticoid receptors within the cells of the distal tubule and\nthe collecting duct of the kidney nephron. This activates the basolateral Na\n  <sup>\n   +\n  </sup>\n  /K\n  <sup>\n   +\n  </sup>\n  pumps, which pump three sodium ions out of the cell and two potassium ions into\nthe cell. This results in reabsorption of sodium (Na\n  <sup>\n   +\n  </sup>\n  ) ions and\nwater (which follows sodium) into the blood, and secreting potassium (K\n  <sup>\n   +\n  </sup>\n  )\nions into the urine (lumen of collecting duct).\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  The\nmineralocorticoid receptor is activated by mineralocorticoids, such as\naldosterone and deoxycorticosterone, as well as glucocorticoids, such as\ncortisol. Normally, the mineralocorticoid receptor is &ldquo;protected&rdquo; from\nglucocorticoids by co-localization of an enzyme, 11&szlig;-hydroxysteroid\ndehydrogenase type 2 (11&szlig;-HSD2), which converts cortisol to inactive cortisone.\nIn states of excess cortisol (Cushing syndrome), the enzymatic activity can be\noverwhelmed such that bound cortisol is not metabolized and there is activation\nof the mineralcorticoid receptor.

Insulin resistance precedes the onset of\ndiabetes, possibly by many decades. About 30% of Americans have insulin\nresistance. This is defined as a decrease in the efficacy of insulin (usually\ndetermined as removal of glucose from the peripheral blood) at any given\ninsulin level. Most people with insulin resistance do\n  <i>\n   not\n  </i>\n  have type 2\ndiabetes mellitus because their pancreas is able to compensate for the\nresistance by producing more insulin. In people who develop diabetes, however,\nthe &beta; cells begin to fail and insulin production declines. At the onset of\ntype 2 diabetes mellitus, about 50% of maximal insulin production is lost.

During reactivation,\nthe virus leaves the nerve cell bodies and travels along axons, causing\ninfection of the skin in the region of the nerve (dermatome).

Though less common than other types of skin cancer, melanoma\nis responsible for 75% of deaths due to skin cancer.

When it starts to\ngrow vertically &ndash; into the epidermis and papillary dermis &ndash; it\nbegins to acquire the potential for metastasis.

While nerve impulse profiles are, for the most part, always the\nsame, skeletal muscles are able to produce varying levels of contractile force.\nThis phenomenon is explained by &ldquo;\n  <i>\n   force summation\n  </i>\n  .&rdquo; Force summation is\nthe addition of individual twitch contractions to increase the intensity of\noverall muscle contraction. It is achieved in two ways: by increasing the\nnumber and size of contractile units simultaneously, called\n  <i>\n   recruitment of\nmotor units\n  </i>\n  <span>\n   ,\n  </span>\n  and by increasing the frequency at which action\npotentials are sent to muscle fibers, called\n  <i>\n   temporal\n   <span>\n    summation\n   </span>\n  </i>\n  .\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Recruitment\nof motor units:\n </span>\n <span>\n  A\nmotor unit includes the motor neuron plus all of the muscle fibers it\ninnervates. The degree of contraction of a skeletal muscle is influenced by the\nnumber of motor units being stimulated. Skeletal muscles consist of numerous\nmotor units and, therefore, stimulating more motor units creates a stronger\ncontraction.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Temporal summation:\n </span>\n An increase in the frequency with which a muscle is stimulated increases the\nstrength of contraction. With rapid stimulation (so rapid that a muscle does\nnot completely relax between successive stimulations), a muscle fiber is\nre-stimulated while there is still some contractile activity. As a result,\nthere is a &ldquo;summation&rdquo; of the contractile force. In addition, with rapid\nstimulation there isn&rsquo;t enough time between successive stimulations to remove\nall the calcium from the sarcoplasm. So with several stimulations in rapid\nsuccession, calcium levels in the sarcoplasm increase. More calcium means more\nactive cross-bridges and, therefore, a stronger contraction. (If a muscle fiber\nis stimulated so rapidly that it does not relax at all between stimuli, a\nsmooth, sustained contraction called\n <span>\n  tetanus\n </span>\n occurs.)\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Skeletal muscles contract\naccording to the\n <i>\n  sliding filament model\n </i>\n <span>\n  (Figure 1).\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  1.\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  An action potential\noriginating in the brain reaches an alpha motor neuron, which then transmits an\naction potential down the axon.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  2.\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  The action potential\npropagates by activating voltage-gated sodium channels along the axon toward\nthe synapse.

In osteoporosis the bone mineral\ndensity (BMD) is reduced and bone microarchitecture deteriorates. Osteoporosis\nis defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a bone mineral density\nthat is 2.5 standard deviations or more below the mean peak bone mass (average\nof young, healthy adults) as measured by DXA.The disease may be classified as\nprimary type 1, primary type 2, or secondary.

Primary type 2 osteoporosis or\n  <span>\n   senile osteoporosis\n  </span>\n  occurs after age 75 and is seen in both females and males at a ratio of 2:1.\nFinally, secondary osteoporosis may arise at any age and affects men and women\nequally.

The three main mechanisms by which osteoporosis develops are an\ninadequate\n  <span>\n   peak bone mass\n  </span>\n  (the skeleton develops insufficient mass\nand strength during growth), excessive bone resorption by osteoclasts, and\ninadequate formation of new bone ny osteoblasts during remodeling.

The adrenal medulla is the core of the adrenal gland, and is\nsurrounded by the adrenal cortex. It secretes approximately 20% norepinephrine\nand 80% epinephrine. The chromaffin cells of the medulla, named for their\ncharacteristic brown staining with chromic acid salts, are the body's main\nsource of the circulating catecholamines: adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline\n(norepinephrine). Catecholamines are derived from the amino acid tyrosine and\nthese water-soluble hormones are the major hormones underlying the\nfight-or-flight response. To carry out its part of this response, the adrenal\nmedulla receives input from the sympathetic nervous system through\npreganglionic fibers originating in the thoracic spinal cord (from T5 -T11).\nThese fibers release acetylcholine, which stimulate the adrenal medulla to\nproduce catecholamines.

These molecules are\nsurrounded by a phospholipid monolayer (represented in green). Within the\nmonolayer are various apoproteins (Apo A, B, C, and E), which interact with\nstructures outside the capsule to direct the transport of cholesterol and\ntriglyceride into and out of the capsule.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Lipoproteins are divided\ninto four major classes based on density: chylomicrons, VLDL (very low density\nlipoprotein), LDL (low density lipoprotein), and HDL (high density\nlipoprotein). Density depends on fat-to-protein ratio. Fat is &ldquo;light&rdquo;; so high\nfat-to-protein ratios mean low density.\n <a name=\"4-u1.0-B978-1-4160-2911-3..50038-8--spar\">\n </a>\n &nbsp;\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Dyslipidemia (abnormal\nlevels of lipoprotein in the blood) occurs when production or clearance of\nlipoproteins is altered.

Primary dyslipidemia results from genetic\ndefects that directly affect lipoproteins. Secondary dyslipidemia is caused by\nconditions, such as diabetes or hypothyroidism, which indirectly affect\nlipoproteins.\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  The most\ncommon primary dyslipidemia is familial hypercholesterolemia, an autosomal\ndominant disorder in which mutation of the LDL receptor gene results in high\nLDL cholesterol levels. LDL cholesterol normally circulates in the body for 2.5\ndays, and subsequently binds to the LDL receptor on liver cells, undergoes\nendocytosis, and is digested. LDL is removed, and synthesis of cholesterol by\nthe liver is suppressed in the HMG-CoA reductase pathway. In familial hypercholesterolemia,\nLDL receptor function is reduced or absent, and LDL circulates for an average\nduration of 4.5 days, resulting in significantly increased level of LDL\ncholesterol in the blood (with normal levels of other lipoproteins). This\nincrease occurs because the enzyme, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA\nreductase, which is involved in cholestrol synthesis, is not repressed.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  [Repression\nof 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase is an effective means of\nlowering serum cholesterol levels.

It has a bimodal\nage distribution, with highest incidence in patients younger than 20 years,\nmost likely related to the normal rapid bone growth that occurs during\nadolescence. In this age group, most tumors arise in the metaphyseal areas of\nthe long bones of the extremities, particularly around the knee.\n </span>\n <span>\n  Over 90% of tumors are located in the metaphysis (the growing ends\nof the bone) the most common sites are the bones around the knee which account\nfor 80% of cases.\n </span>\n <span>\n  Males\nare affected more commonly than females at a ratio of 3:2. A second peak of\nincidence occurs in adults older than 60 years.

Radiographically, osteosarcomas\nusually present as mixed osteoblastic and osteolytic lesions, although pure\nforms of either appearance can occur.

The peak incidence is in\nthe fifth to seventh decades of life. The most common primary sites are in the\npelvis, proximal femur, and proximal humerus. Patients present with\nlong-standing complaints of swelling, pain, or both. Radiographically,\nchondrosarcoma is detected as an area of radiolucency with variable punctate\nmineralization, with frequent cortical bone erosion or thickening, sometimes\nwith extension into adjacent soft tissue.

As with osteosarcoma, the\npeak incidence occurs during the second decade of life, but unlike\nosteosarcoma, the incidence of Ewing's is unimodal, being distinctly unusual in\nolder adults and in nonwhites. Ewing's sarcoma tends to arise in the diaphyseal\nregion of long bones, in the pelvis, or in ribs. Ewing's tumors are\ncharacterized radiologically by a permeative or &ldquo;moth-eaten&rdquo; appearance of the\naffected bone, with a multilayered &ldquo;onion-skin&rdquo; periosteal reaction. MRI\nstudies frequently document a significant soft tissue mass associated with the\nbone lesion. Unlike other sarcomas of bone, Ewing's sarcoma may present with\nsymptoms of an inflammatory systemic illness, with intermittent fevers, anemia,\nleukocytosis, and an increased sedimentation rate.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <b>\n  <span>\n   Metastatic Tumors to Bone\n  </span>\n </b>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Tumors\nmetastatic to bone are important causes of cancer-related morbidity. Effective\nprevention and treatment of skeleton-related metastases are an important part\nof clinical care for many cancer patients.

Plain radiographs may demonstrate blastic or lytic lesions.\nAlthough prostate cancer is generally blastic and multiple myeloma usually\nlytic, most other tumors have a mixed appearance. In patients with one\ndocumented bone metastasis or in patients with widely metastatic disease and\nbone pain, a radiologic survey can identify bone metastases that may ultimately\nplace the patient at risk for a pathologic fracture. Technetium diphosphonate\nbone scans are useful to delineate the extent of bony metastases and in\nfollowing response to therapy. However, a negative study must be interpreted\ncautiously for tumors that are potentially purely lytic because these may be\nundetectable by bone scan. In such tumors (e.g., multiple myeloma), a skeletal\nsurvey is therefore preferable. Routine screening for bone metastases is not\nindicated for cancer patients with no symptoms or signs of bone involvement.\n </span>\n</p>\n", "question": "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  A 14-year-old boy presents with complaints of right knee pain of\napproximately 2 months' duration.

In this condition,\n    there is a failure of 21-hydroxylation of 17-hydroxyprogesterone and\n    progesterone to 11-deoxycortisol and 11-deoxycorticosterone, respectively,\n    with deficient cortisol and aldosterone production. Cortisol deficiency\n    leads to increased ACTH release, causing overproduction of\n    17-hydroxyprogesterone and progesterone. Increased ACTH production also\n    leads to increased biosynthesis of androstenedione and DHEA, which can be\n    converted to testosterone.\n        </span>\n       </p>\n       <p class=\"\">\n        <span>\n         Patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiencies can be divided into\n    two clinical phenotypes: classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency, usually\n    diagnosed at birth or during childhood, and late-onset 21-hydroxylase\n    deficiency, which develops during or after puberty. Patients with classic\n    21-hydroxylase deficiency have various degrees of mineralocorticoid\n    deficiency (salt-losing form) and virilization. The most useful measurement\n    for the diagnosis of classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency is that of plasma\n    17-hydroxyprogesterone. A value greater than 200 ng/dL is consistent with\n    the diagnosis. Late-onset 21-hydroxylase deficiency usually develops around\n    the time of puberty with signs of virilization (hirsutism and acne) and\n    amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea. This diagnosis should be considered in women\n    with unexplained hirsutism and menstrual abnormalities or infertility. The\n    aim of treatment for classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency is to replace\n    glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids, suppress ACTH and androgen\n    overproduction, and allow for normal growth and sexual maturation in\n    children.\n         <a name=\"P067023\">\n         </a>\n         &nbsp;\n        </span>\n       </p>\n      </td>\n     </tr>\n    </table>\n    <table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"\" width=\"100%\">\n     <tr>\n      <td width=\"100%\">\n       <p class=\"\">\n        <a name=\"P067025\">\n        </a>\n        <span>\n         11&beta;-Hydroxylase (CYP11B1)\n    deficiency accounts for about 5% of the patients with CAH. In this\n    syndrome, the conversions of 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol and 11-deoxycorticosterone\n    to corticosterone (the precursor to aldosterone) are blocked. Affected\n    patients usually have hypertension and hypokalemia because of increased\n    amounts of precursors with mineralocorticoid activity. Virilization occurs,\n    as with 21-hydroxylase deficiency, and a late-onset form exhibiting as\n    androgen excess also occurs.

PTHrP mimics the actions of\n    parathyroid hormone (PTH) on the kidney to prevent calcium excretion and on\n    the skeleton to activate osteoclasts and induce bone resorption. Tumors\n    classically associated with the HHM mechanism are breast cancer, squamous\n    carcinomas of any site (including larynx, lung, cervix, and esophagus),\n    renal carcinomas, and ovarian carcinomas. These observations, together with\n    histologic evidence for aggressive bone resorption at sites within the\n    skeleton not involved by tumor, make clear that HHM is indeed the result of\n    a tumor-derived&nbsp;\n        <i>\n         humor\n        </i>\n        &nbsp;or hormone.

History, physical examination, and laboratory\n  tests can be helpful in differentiating benign from malignant lesions. For\n  example, lymph node involvement or hoarseness is strongly suggestive of a\n  malignant tumor.\n    </span>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     &nbsp;\n    </span>\n   </p>\n   <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n    <b>\n     <span>\n      High-Risk Factors for Malignancy\n  in a Thyroid Nodule\n     </span>\n    </b>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n</table>\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n <table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"\">\n  <tr>\n   <td valign=\"top\" width=\"279\">\n    <p class=\"\">\n     <b>\n      <span>\n       History\n      </span>\n     </b>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td valign=\"top\" width=\"279\">\n    <p class=\"\">\n     <span>\n      Head and neck irradiation\n     </span>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td valign=\"top\" width=\"279\">\n    <p class=\"\">\n     <span>\n      Exposure to nuclear radiation\n     </span>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td valign=\"top\" width=\"279\">\n    <p class=\"\">\n     <span>\n      Rapid growth\n     </span>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td valign=\"top\" width=\"279\">\n    <p class=\"\">\n     <span>\n      Recent onset\n     </span>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td valign=\"top\" width=\"279\">\n    <p class=\"\">\n     <span>\n      Young age\n     </span>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td valign=\"top\" width=\"279\">\n    <p class=\"\">\n     <span>\n      Male sex\n     </span>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td valign=\"top\" width=\"279\">\n    <p class=\"\">\n     <span>\n      Familial incidence (medullary and about 5% of papillary)\n     </span>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td valign=\"top\" width=\"279\">\n    <p class=\"\">\n     <b>\n      <span>\n       Physical Examination\n      </span>\n     </b>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td valign=\"top\" width=\"279\">\n    <p class=\"\">\n     <span>\n      Hard consistency of nodule\n     </span>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td valign=\"top\" width=\"279\">\n    <p class=\"\">\n     <span>\n      Fixation of nodule\n     </span>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td valign=\"top\" width=\"279\">\n    <p class=\"\">\n     <span>\n      Lymphadenopathy\n     </span>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td valign=\"top\" width=\"279\">\n    <p class=\"\">\n     <span>\n      Vocal cord paralysis\n     </span>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td valign=\"top\" width=\"279\">\n    <p class=\"\">\n     <span>\n      Distant metastasis\n     </span>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td valign=\"top\" width=\"279\">\n    <p class=\"\">\n     <b>\n      <span>\n       Laboratory and Imaging\n      </span>\n     </b>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td valign=\"top\" width=\"279\">\n    <p class=\"\">\n     <span>\n      Elevated serum calcitonin\n     </span>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td valign=\"top\" width=\"279\">\n    <p class=\"\">\n     <i>\n      <span>\n       Cold\n      </span>\n     </i>\n     <span>\n      &nbsp;nodule on technetium scan\n     </span>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td valign=\"top\" width=\"279\">\n    <p class=\"\">\n     <span>\n      Solid lesion with microcalcifications on ultrasonography\n     </span>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n </table>\n</div>\n\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"\" width=\"100%\">\n <tr>\n  <td width=\"100%\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <a name=\"P066059\">\n    </a>\n    <span>\n     &nbsp;\n    </span>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     The major etiologic factor for thyroid cancer is childhood or\n  adolescent exposure to head and neck radiation.

The condition may be caused by ABO or Rh incompatibility between mother\nand child. In this case, we are told that the mother is Rh positive; therefore,\nhemolysis is not caused by Rh incompatibility. (For hemolysis to be due to Rh\nincompatibility the mother would have to be Rh negative and the child Rh\npositive.) Rather, hemolysis must be due to ABO incompatibility. Most\nantibodies directed against ABO antigens are of the IgM class and do not cross\nthe placenta. However, individuals with type O blood group can produce IgG\nantibodies that cross the placenta and cause hemolysis. &ldquo;E&rdquo; is the correct\nanswer because the mother in &ldquo;E&rdquo; has type O blood group. She most likely has\nIgG antibodies against A and B, which can cross the placenta.\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"row\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\"row text-center\"><h4>Tutorial</h4></div>\n<p>\n <span>\n  The\n  <b>\n   ABO antigens\n  </b>\n  are carbohydrates linked to cell surface proteins and lipids. They are\nsynthesized by polymorphic glycosyltransferase enzymes, which vary in activity\ndepending on the inherited allele\n </span>\n . The ABO antigens were the first\nalloantigen system to be defined in mammals.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n All normal individuals\nsynthesize the O antigen, which is attached to plasma membrane proteins. Most\nindividuals possess a fucosyltransferase that adds a fucose moiety to the O\nantigen, resulting in an H antigen. A single gene on chromosome 9 encodes a\nglycosyltransferase enzyme, which further modifies the H antigen. There are\nthree allelic variants of this gene. The O allele gene product is devoid of\nenzymatic activity. The A allele-encoded enzyme transfers a terminal\n <span>\n  N\n </span>\n -acetylgalactosamine\nmoiety, and the B allele gene product transfers a terminal galactose moiety.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Individuals who are\nhomozygous for the O allele cannot attach terminal sugars to the H antigen and\nexpress only the H antigen. In contrast, individuals who possess an A allele\n(AA homozygotes, AO heterozygotes, or AB heterozygotes) form the A antigen by\nadding terminal\n <span>\n  N\n </span>\n -acetylgalactosamine to some of their H antigens.\nSimilarly, individuals who express a B allele (BB homozygotes, BO\nheterozygotes, or AB heterozygotes) form the B antigen by adding terminal\ngalactose to some of their H antigens. AB heterozygotes form both A and B\nantigens from some of their H antigens. The terminology has been simplified so\nthat OO individuals are said to be blood type O; AA and AO individuals are\nblood type A; BB and BO individuals are blood type B; and AB individuals are\nblood type AB.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Individuals who\nexpress a particular ABO antigen are tolerant to that antigen, but individuals\nwho do not express that antigen produce natural antibodies that recognize the\nantigen.\n </span>\n Individuals who express A or B antigens are tolerant to these\nmolecules and do not produce anti-A or anti-B antibodies, respectively.\nHowever, bacteria present in the GI tract contain antigens similar to the A and\nB blood group antigens, therefore blood group O and A individuals produce\nanti-B IgM antibodies, and blood group O and B individuals produce anti-A IgM\nantibodies.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  In clinical\ntransfusion, the choice of blood donors for a particular recipient is based on\nthe expression of blood group antigens and the antibody responses to them.\n </span>\n If a patient receives a transfusion of red blood cells from a donor who\nexpresses the antigen not expressed on self red blood cells, a transfusion\nreaction may result. It follows that AB individuals can tolerate transfusions\nfrom all potential donors and are therefore called universal recipients;\nsimilarly, O individuals can tolerate transfusions only from O donors but can\nprovide blood to all recipients and are therefore called universal donors. In\ngeneral, differences in\n <i>\n  minor\n </i>\n blood groups lead to red cell lysis only\nafter repeated transfusions trigger a secondary antibody response.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n ABO antigens are expressed\non many other cell types in addition to blood cells, including endothelial\ncells. For this reason, ABO typing is critical to avoid hyperacute rejection of\ncertain solid organ allografts. ABO incompatibility between mother and fetus\ngenerally does not cause problems for the fetus because most of the\nanti-carbohydrate antibodies are IgM and do not cross the placenta. Individuals\nwith blood group O, however, can produce IgG antibodies against A and B\nantigens, which can cross the placenta and can cause intrauterine hemolysis in\nthe fetus, although clinically significant hemolysis related to ABO\nincompatibility is rare.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The\n <b>\n  Rhesus (Rh) antigens\n </b>\n ,\nnamed after the monkey species in which they were originally identified, are\nanother clinically important group of blood group antigens. Rh proteins are\nencoded by two tightly linked genes, but only one of them, called RhD, is\ncommonly considered in clinical blood typing. This is because up to 15% of the\npopulation has an alteration of the RhD allele. These people, called Rh\nnegative, are not tolerant to the RhD antigen and will make antibodies to the\nantigen if they are exposed to Rh-positive blood cells.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n The major clinical\nsignificance of anti-Rh antibodies is related to hemolytic reactions associated\nwith pregnancy that are similar to transfusion reactions. Rh-negative mothers\ncarrying an Rh-positive fetus can be sensitized by fetal red blood cells that\nenter the maternal circulation, usually during childbirth. Since the Rh antigen\nis a protein, as opposed to the carbohydrate ABO antigens, class-switched IgG\nantibodies are generated in Rh-negative mothers. Subsequent pregnancies in\nwhich the fetus is Rh positive are at risk because the maternal anti-Rh IgG\nantibodies can cross the placenta and mediate the destruction of the fetal red\nblood cells. This causes\n <span>\n  erythroblastosis fetalis\n </span>\n (hemolytic\ndisease of the newborn) and can be lethal for the fetus.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Rh alloimmunization in\nRh-negative women can be prevented by administration of anti-RhD antibodies to\nthe mother at 28 weeks of gestation, after amniocentesis or chorionic villus\nsampling, after vaginal bleeding or within 72 hours of birth of an Rh-positive\nbaby. The treatment prevents the baby's Rh-positive red blood cells that\nentered the mother's circulation from inducing the production of anti-Rh\nantibodies in the mother.

People of African, Middle Eastern,\nSouth Asian, and Mediterranean descent are predominantly affected. G6PD\ndeficiency is an X-linked disorder characterized by abnormally low levels of\nglucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, an enzyme involved in the pentose phosphate\npathway, which is especially important in red blood cell metabolism. Individuals\nwith the disease exhibit nonimmune hemolytic anemia in response to a number of\ncauses, most commonly infection or exposure to certain medications or\nchemicals. G6PD deficiency is closely linked to\n <span>\n  favism\n </span>\n , a disorder\ncharacterized by a hemolytic response to broad bean consumption. (The name is\nderived from the Italian name for broad bean:\n <i>\n  fava\n </i>\n ). Most individuals\nwith G6PD deficiency are asymptomatic. Symptomatic patients are usually male\n(due to an X-linked pattern of inheritance), but female carriers can be\nclinically affected due to unfavorable Lyonization, where random inactivation\nof an X-chromosome in certain cells creates a population of G6PD-deficient red\nblood cells coexisting with normal red cells.\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Many\nsubstances are potentially harmful to people with G6PD deficiency. Certain\nantimalarial drugs (e.g. primaquine, pamaquine and chloroquine) can cause\nhemolysis in people with G6PD deficiency. Sulfonamides (e.g. sulfamethoxazole),\nmethylene blue, and naphthalene should also be avoided by people with G6PD\ndeficiency, as should certain analgesics (e.g. aspirin) and a few non-sulfa\nantibiotics (nalidixic acid, nitrofurantoin, isoniazid, and dapsone). Glucose-6-phosphate\ndehydrogenase is an enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway. It converts\nglucose-6-phosphate to 6-phosphoglucono-&delta;-lactone, and it is the\nrate-limiting enzyme in this pathway. The pentose phosphate pathway supplies\nreducing equivalents to cells by maintaining the level of nicotinamide adenine\ndinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). NADPH, in turn, maintains the supply of reduced\nglutathione, which is used to mop up free radicals that cause oxidative damage.\nThe G6PD / NADPH pathway is the\n  <i>\n   only\n  </i>\n  source of biochemical reductant\nneeded to maintain reduced glutathione in red blood cells.

As a consequence of\nthe biochemical reactions in which homocysteine is involved, deficiencies of\nthe vitamins pyridoxine (B\n <sub>\n  6\n </sub>\n ), folic acid (B\n <sub>\n  9\n </sub>\n ), or B\n <sub>\n  12\n </sub>\n can lead to high homocysteine levels. Supplementation with pyridoxine, folic\nacid, or B\n <sub>\n  12\n </sub>\n reduces the concentration of homocysteine in the\nbloodstream. A high level of homocysteine makes a person more prone to\nendothelial injury, which leads to vascular inflammation, which in turn may\nlead to atherogenesis, which can result in ischemic injury.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Hyperhomocysteinemia is a\nrisk factor for blood clots, heart attacks, and strokes. It can cause\nmiscarriage and is associated with pre-eclampsia. Hyperhomocysteinemia usually\noccurs in people with at least one defective gene that affects breakdown of homocysteine.\nDefects in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) or methioninesynthetase\nare associated with hyperhomocysteinemia. Both enzymes are involved in the\nconversion of homocysteine to methionine. Consequently, individuals with\nhyperhomocysteinemia often have decreased levels of methionine.\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <b>\n  <span>\n   Answer\nD is incorrect\n  </span>\n </b>\n <span>\n  .\nVon Willebrand deficiency predisposes to bleeding, not hypercoagulability.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <b>\n  <span>\n   Answer\nE is incorrect\n  </span>\n </b>\n <span>\n  .\nFactor VIII deficiency (hemophilia A) predisposes to bleeding, not\nhypercoagulability.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"row\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\"row text-center\"><h4>Tutorial</h4></div>\n<p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Risk factors for deep venous thrombosis (DVT)\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"\">\n <tr>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"221\">\n   <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Genetic\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"221\">\n   <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Acquired\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"221\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     &nbsp;\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"221\">\n   <p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     &nbsp;\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n <tr>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"221\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Factor V\n  Leiden*\n    </span>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Prothrombin\n  G20210A mutation\n    </span>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Antithrombin\n  III deficiency\n    </span>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Protein\n  S deficiency\n    </span>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Protein\n  C deficiency\n    </span>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     &nbsp;\n    </span>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     *Suspect\n  genetic cause if patient has&hellip;\n    </span>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     &middot;\n     <span>\n      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n     </span>\n    </span>\n    <span>\n     Unexplained\n  DVT\n    </span>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     &middot;\n     <span>\n      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n     </span>\n    </span>\n    <span>\n     Recurrent\n  DVT\n    </span>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     &middot;\n     <span>\n      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n     </span>\n    </span>\n    <span>\n     FMH\n  of DVT\n    </span>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     &nbsp;\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n  <td valign=\"top\" width=\"221\">\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Surgery/Trauma\n    </span>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Immobilization\n    </span>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  Bedridden &gt; 3 days\n    </span>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  Air flights &gt; 6-8 hours\n    </span>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Obesity\n    </span>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Venous\n  stasis\n    </span>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Pregnancy\n    </span>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Stroke\n    </span>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Congestive\n  heart failure\n    </span>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Nephrotic\n  syndrome\n    </span>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Cancer\n    </span>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Medicine:\n  OCs, HRT\n    </span>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Antiphospholipid\n  antibody syndrome\n    </span>\n   </p>\n   <p class=\"\">\n    <span>\n     Hyperhomocysteinemia\n    </span>\n   </p>\n  </td>\n </tr>\n</table>\n\n<p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n <span>\n  * Factor V Leiden is the most common hereditary hypercoagulability\ndisorder.\n </span>\n</p>\n", "question": "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Five days\nafter undergoing a right total hip replacement, a 68-year old man experiences\nsharp chest pain and shortness of breath.

It affects B\ncell lymphocytes, which originate in the bone marrow, develop in lymph nodes,\nand normally fight infection by producing antibodies. In CLL, the DNA of a B\ncell is damaged, so that it cannot produce antibodies; patients are often\nimmunocompromised as a result. B cells grow out of control and accumulate in\nthe bone marrow and blood, where they crowd out healthy blood cells. CLL\nusually presents in adults; most newly diagnosed patients are over the age of\n50. Affected individuals are often symptomatic. The clue to the diagnosis may\nbe an abnormal blood test; patients typically have a high white blood cell\ncount with a preponderance of mature lymphocytes. As CLL progresses,\nlymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, and eventually anemia and\ninfections occur. Early CLL is typically not treated; late CLL is treated with\nchemotherapy and other modalities. Molecular&nbsp; analysis has distinguished\ntwo major types of CLL with different survival times. CLL lacking somatic\nhypermutation of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene is usually positive for\nthe marker ZAP-70 has an average survival of 5 years. CLL with somatic\nhypermutation of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene is negative for ZAP-70 and\nhas an average survival of more than 25 years. Many patients, especially older\nones, with slowly progressing disease can be reassured that they may not need\nany treatment in their lifetime.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <b>\n  Chronic myelogenous\nleukemia\n </b>\n <b>\n  (\n  <span>\n   CML\n  </span>\n  )\n </b>\n is a form of leukemia characterized by\nthe increased and unregulated growth of predominantly myeloid cells in the bone\nmarrow and the accumulation of these cells in the blood. CML is a clonal bone\nmarrow stem cell disorder in which proliferation of mature granulocytes\n(neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils) and their precursors is the main\nfinding. It is a type of myeloproliferative neoplasm associated with a\ncharacteristic chromosomal translocation called the Philadelphia chromosome.\nPatients are often asymptomatic at diagnosis, presenting incidentally with an\nelevated white blood cell count on a routine laboratory test. Symptoms of CML\nmay include left-sided abdominal pain due to an enlarged spleen, malaise, joint\nor hip pain, anemia, and thrombocytopenia with easy bruising (although an\n <i>\n  increased\n </i>\n platelet count may also occur). CML is often suspected on the basis of an\nabnormal blood count, which shows increased granulocytes of all types,\ntypically including mature myeloid cells. Basophils and eosinophils are almost\nalways increased. A bone marrow biopsy is performed as part of the evaluation.\nCML is diagnosed by detecting the Philadelphia chromosome. The\n <span>\n  Philadelphia\nchromosome\n </span>\n is specific for CML. It is the result of a reciprocal\ntranslocation between chromosome 9 and 22. The genes involved are\n <i>\n  abl1\n </i>\n (Abelson protoncogene) on chromosome 9, a tyrosine kinase, and\n <i>\n  bcr\n </i>\n (breakpoint cluster region) on chromosome 22; the resulting fusion gene leads\nto dysregulation of the abl tyrosine kinase. CML is now largely treated with\ntyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as imatinib mesylate (Gleevec), which\nhave led to dramatically improved survival rates.\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n <span>\n  <img alt=\"Description: philadelphia_chromosome\" border=\"0\" height=\"186\" id=\"Picture 347350\" src=\"static/img/tutorials/image227.png\" width=\"240\"/>\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <b>\n  <span>\n   Acute\nlymphoblastic leukemia\n  </span>\n </b>\n <b>\n  <span>\n   (\n   <span>\n    ALL\n   </span>\n   )\n  </span>\n </b>\n <span>\n  is a form of leukemia characterized by excess\nlymphoblasts. It is most common in childhood with a peak incidence at 2-5 years\nof age, and another peak in old age. The overall cure rate in children is about\n80%. &ldquo;\n  <span>\n   Acute&rdquo;\n  </span>\n  refers to the relatively short time course of the\ndisease, being fatal in as little as a few weeks if untreated. Findings may\ninclude fatigue, anemia, weight loss, loss of appetite, excessive bruising,\nbone pain, joint pain, breathlessness, enlarged lymph nodes, hepatomegaly,\nsplenomegaly, and petechiae (due to thrombocytopenia).&nbsp; Symptoms are so\ngeneral that many other diseases must be considered in the differential\ndiagnosis. Typically, the higher the white blood cell count, the worse the\nprognosis. Blast cells are seen on blood smears in majority of cases.\nDefinitive diagnosis is made by flow cytometry on peripheral blood or bone\nmarrow. Important prognostic factors include age, WBC count and cytogenetic\nanalysis. The majority of cases are composed of immature B lineage cells (B\nlymphoblastic leukemia or precursor B-cell ALL); a minority are composed of\nimmature T lineage cells (T lymphoblastic or precursor T-cell ALL). Treatment\nis prolonged (2.5 to 3 years) and includes a long maintenance phase. Central\nnervous system relapse is common if prophylactic treatment is not used.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <b>\n  Acute myeloid leukemia\n </b>\n is a cancer of the myeloid line of blood cells, characterized by the rapid\ngrowth of immature myeloid cells that accumulate in the bone marrow and\ninterfere with the production of normal mature blood cells. AML is the most\ncommon acute leukemia affecting adults. Symptoms are caused by replacement of\nnormal bone marrow with leukemic cells, which causes a drop in red blood cells,\nplatelets, and normal white blood cells. These symptoms include fatigue,\nshortness of breath, easy bruising and bleeding, bone pain, joint pain, and\nincreased risk of infection. As an acute leukemia, AML progresses rapidly and\nis typically fatal within weeks or months if untreated. Enlargement of the\nspleen may occur but is usually mild and asymptomatic. Lymph node swelling is\nrare, in contrast to acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The first clue to a\ndiagnosis of AML is typically an abnormal blood count.&nbsp; While an excess of\nabnormal white blood cells (leukocytosis) is a common finding, and leukemic\nblasts are sometimes seen, AML can also present with\n <i>\n  low\n </i>\n white blood\ncell count. Definitive diagnosis usually requires an adequate bone marrow\naspiration and biopsy. Auer rods, which are specific for AML, may be seen. Auer\nrods are clumps of azurophilic granular material that form elongated needles\nseen in the cytoplasm of leukemic blasts. Important prognostic factors include\nage, results of cytogenetic analysis, and more recently the presence of\nspecific genetic mutations.\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n <span>\n  <img alt=\"Description: stains1\" border=\"0\" height=\"204\" id=\"Picture 347349\" src=\"static/img/tutorials/image228.png\" width=\"293\"/>\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/Myeloblast_with_Auer_rod_smear_2010-01-27.JPG\">\n  <span>\n   <img alt=\"Description: Description: File:Myeloblast with Auer rod smear 2010-01-27.JPG\" border=\"0\" height=\"265\" id=\"Picture 347348\" src=\"static/img/tutorials/image229.png\" width=\"353\"/>\n  </span>\n </a>\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n Auer\nrods in a patient with AML\n</p>\n", "question": "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Match each\nof the following vignettes with the most likely type of leukemia.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  1.

Early recognition and treatment of PV are important because untreated\n    patients with PV suffer significant morbidity and mortality from\n    thromboembolic disease in the cerebral, coronary, and mesenteric\n    circulations. Twenty percent of patients show symptoms of arterial and\n    venous thrombosis, and thrombosis remains the most common cause of death.\n    Typically, patients complain of headache, visual problems, mental clouding,\n    and pruritus after bathing. Occlusive vascular events such as stroke,\n    transient ischemic attacks, myocardial ischemia, and digital pain,\n    paresthesias, or gangrene are common. In addition, pulmonary, deep vein,\n    hepatic, and portal vein thromboses may occur. Paradoxically, patients are\n    also predisposed to hemorrhagic events, which are presumably caused by\n    abnormal platelet function, and such patients may exhibit gastrointestinal\n    bleeding.

In humans,\nthe hemoglobin molecule is an assembly of four globular protein subunits: 2\n\u03ac chains and 2 &beta; chains. Each chain is tightly associated with a\nnon-protein heme group.

Specifically, there is an\nadenine-to-thymidine substitution in codon 6 of the &beta;-globin gene, which\nresults in replacement of glutamic acid by valine. This change results in an\nabnormal type of hemoglobin, hemoglobin S (HbS), which polymerizes when\ndeoxygenated. This causes red blood cell sickling. The term\n  <i>\n   sickle cell\n  </i>\n  <i>\n   anemia\n  </i>\n  refers to patients who are homozygous for the sickle-cell mutation (HbSS).\nSickle cell anemia is, therefore, one of many types of sickle-cell disease, all\nof which are characterized by varying degrees of red blood cell sickling,\nhemolytic anemia, vasculopathy, vaso-occlusion, acute and chronic organ damage,\nand reduced lifespan.

Some patients have almost all known complications;\nothers have almost none but die suddenly; still others skip one or more phases\nof disease but suffer intensely from others. Although sickle-cell disease is a\nprototypic Mendelian, single-gene disorder, it behaves clinically as a\nmultigenic trait with phenotypic variability.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Hemolysis is mainly\nextravascular due to erythrophagocytosis by reticuloendothelial cells, which\nrecognize the damaged sickle cells. In some patients, intravascular hemolysis\noccurs, liberating excessive amounts of hemoglobin into the circulation.\nCertain complications, such as pulmonary hypertension, priapism, leg ulcer, and\nstroke, are closely linked to the intensity of hemolysis, whereas other\ncomplications, such as painful episodes, acute chest syndrome, and osteonecrosis,\nare linked to high blood viscosity and the interactions among sickle cells,\nleukocytes, and the endothelium.\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span class=\"section-title-10\">\n  <b>\n   <span>\n    Painful Crisis\n   </span>\n  </b>\n </span>\n <span class=\"text\">\n  <b>\n   <span>\n   </span>\n  </b>\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Pain caused by sickle\nvaso-occlusion often starts in young children as the hand-foot syndrome:\npainful swelling of the hands and feet caused by inflammation of the metacarpal\nand metatarsal periosteum. Acute painful episodes are the most common\nvaso-occlusive events. What triggers them is usually unknown. They are usually\nsevere and last from hours to days. These attacks of acute pain must be\ndistinguished from chronic pain caused by osteonecrosis of the hips and\nshoulders, neuropathic pain, and milder non-specific pains that are often\npresent between episodes. Painful crises are usually stereotypical, affecting\nindividuals in the same manner from episode to episode.

Red blood cell production is arrested for two to three\ndays. In normal individuals, this would be of little consequence, but in patients\nwith sickle-cell disease, it is life-threatening (because red blood cell life\nis shortened). Reticulocyte counts drop dramatically and patient becomes\nseverely anemic, resulting in fatigue, pallor, and tachycardia.

A &ldquo;functional asplenia&rdquo; ensues, increasing the\npatient&rsquo;s risk of infection with encapsulated organisms. Howell-Jowell bodies\n(indicative of an asplenic state) are often present in the blood at this time.\nOnce splenic infarction has occurred, the patient is no longer predisposed to\nsplenic sequestration.

In patients with congenital\n  or familial TTP, mutations in the vWF-cleaving protease, ADAMTS-13, abrogate\n  its activity. Patients with acquired TTP without a family history usually\n  have an antibody, often immunoglobulin G (IgG) that blocks the normal\n  function of this vWF-cleaving protease to less than 10% of normal. Ultralarge\n  vWF multimers released by endothelial cells normally anchor to endothelial\n  cells through P-selectin and form long strings that adhere and aggregate\n  platelets in the microcirculation. ADAMTS-13 downregulates the size of these\n  multimers. Deficient cleaving protease function in TTP leads to higher circulating\n  levels of the larger, high-molecular-weight vWF multimers; these, in turn,\n  cause increased platelet adhesion and clearance&nbsp;\n     <i>\n      without\n     </i>\n     &nbsp;activating\n  the coagulation cascade. Therefore, both the PT and PTT are normal in TTP,\n  unlike DIC. TTP after chemotherapy (mitomycin C) and in association with\n  pregnancy, stem cell transplantation, lupus, or HIV infection appears to have\n  a similar pathogenic mechanism of thrombosis. Thrombocytopenia (often severe)\n  is accompanied by microangiopathy with schistocytes on the peripheral smear\n  and increased serum lactate dehydrogenase.

Dysarthria is limited to the spoken word; aphasia\naffects oral and written language. Dysarthria usually indicates motor\ndysfunction; aphasia represents dysfunction of the language system.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  All\naphasic syndromes are characterized by difficulty recalling words and naming\nobjects. This difficulty is not limited to a single sensory modality. For\nexample, a patient who cannot identify a set of keys will have trouble whether\nhe sees the keys, feels them, or hears them jangle. In right-handed persons,\naphasia is almost always rooted in the left cerebral hemisphere (usually in the\ncortex). More than half of left-handed aphasics have had damage to the left\nhemisphere; the others have right hemispheric or bilateral damage.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  If a\npatient&rsquo;s only language deficit is recalling words or naming objects, the\naphasia is described as &ldquo;anomic.&rdquo; Anomia implies dysfunction somewhere in the\nleft hemispheric language system. Other language disturbances allow a more\nprecise anatomic localization.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Two\ncortical areas adjacent to the left sylvian fissure are especially important\nfor language: Broca&rsquo;s area, which is located anteriorly, and Wernicke&rsquo;s area,\nwhich is located posteriorly (Figure 10-1). These areas are connected by the\narcuate fasciculus (a bundle of white matter). Broca&rsquo;s area, Wernicke&rsquo;s area,\nand the pathways connecting these two areas constitute the perisylvian core of\nthe language system. The perisylvian core includes inferior portions of the\nleft frontal and parietal lobes and a superior portion of the left temporal\nlobe.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Wernicke&rsquo;s\narea is important for language reception and comprehension. Broca&rsquo;s area is\nimportant for reproduction of speech. Damage to Wernicke&rsquo;s area causes poor\ncomprehension. Damage to Broca&rsquo;s area causes decreased fluency. A lesion in any\npart of the perisylvian core impairs repetition (see table below).\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  The\npatient in this vignette has trouble naming objects, which occurs in all types\nof aphasia. His inability to repeat words indicates a lesion in the perisylvian\ncore. His comprehension is normal, indicating that Wernicke&rsquo;s area is intact,\nand his speech is fluent, indicating that Broca&rsquo;s area is intact. The lesion\nmust lie, therefore, in the conduction pathways between these two locations.\nSuch aphasia is termed &ldquo;conduction&rdquo; aphasia.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  In

It may be static, the result of a unique global\nbrain injury, or progressive, resulting in long-term decline due to damage or\ndisease in the body. Although dementia is far more common in the geriatric\npopulation, it can occur before the age of 65, in which case it is termed &ldquo;early\nonset dementia.&rdquo;\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Dementia is a syndrome\n(i.e., set of signs and symptoms) in which affected areas of cognition may be\nmemory, attention, language, and problem solving. It is normally required to be\npresent for at least 6 months to be diagnosed. In all types of general\ncognitive dysfunction, higher mental functions are affected first in the\nprocess.Dementia reduces the ability to learn, reason, retain or recall past\nexperiences. There is also loss of patterns of thoughts, feelings and\nactivities. As dementia worsens individuals may neglect themselves and may\nbecome disinhibited or incontinent. Especially in the later stages of the\ncondition, affected persons may be disoriented in time (not knowing what day of\nthe week, day of the month, or even what year it is), in place (not knowing\nwhere they are), and in person (not knowing who they, or others around them,\nare).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Dementia, though often\ntreatable to some degree, is usually due to causes that are progressive and\nincurable.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Symptoms of dementia can be\nclassified as either reversible or irreversible. Less than 10% of cases of\ndementia are due to causes that may presently be reversed with treatment.\nWithout careful assessment of history, the short-term syndrome of delirium\n(often lasting days to weeks) can easily be confused with dementia, because\nthey have all symptoms in common, save duration. Some mental illnesses,\nincluding depression and psychosis, may produce symptoms that must be\ndifferentiated from both delirium and dementia.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n There are many specific\ntypes (causes) of dementia, often showing slightly different symptoms. However,\nthe symptom overlap is such that it is impossible to diagnose the type of\ndementia by symptomatology alone, and in only a few cases are symptoms enough\nto give a high probability of some specific cause. Certainty cannot be attained\nexcept with brain biopsy during life or at necropsy in death. Some of the most\ncommon forms of dementia are: Alzheimer disease, vascular dementia,\nfrontotemporal dementia, semantic dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies.\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Currently,\nthere are no medications that are clinically proven to be preventative or\ncurative of dementia. Although some medications are approved for use in the\ntreatment of dementia, these treat the behavioral and cognitive symptoms of\ndementia, but have no effect on the underlying pathophysiology.\nAcetylcholinesterase inhibitors -- Tacrine (Cognex), donepezil (Aricept),\ngalantamine (Razadyne), and rivastigmine (Exelon) -- are approved for treatment\nof dementia induced by Alzheimer disease. They may be useful for other similar\ndiseases causing dementia such as Parkinson disease or vascular dementia.\nAcetylcholinesterase inhibitors aim to increase the amount of the\nneurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is deficient in people with dementia.\nThis is done by inhibiting the action of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, which\nbreaks down acetylcholine as part of normal brain function.

Hydrocephalus can be caused\nby obstruction of CSF flow or by overproduction of CSF by the choroid plexus\n(e.g. choroid plexus papilloma).\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"row\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\"row text-center\"><h4>Tutorial</h4></div>\n<p>\n <span>\n  Hydrocephalus\n </span>\n is a medical condition in which there is an abnormal accumulation of\ncerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the ventricles of the brain. This may cause\nincreased intracranial pressure inside the skull and progressive enlargement of\nthe head, convulsion, tunnel vision, mental disability, and death. The clinical\npresentation of hydrocephalus varies with chronicity.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Acute dilatation of the\nventricular system is more likely to manifest with the signs and symptoms of\nincreased intracranial pressure, such as headache, vomiting, papilledema,\nsleepiness, or coma.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Elevated intracranial\npressure may result in uncal and/or cerebellar tonsil herniation, with\nresulting life threatening brain stem compression. By contrast chronic\ndilatation (especially in the elderly population) may have a more insidious\nonset, presenting, for instance, with Hakim's triad: gait instability, urinary\nincontinence and dementia. This triad is typical of the condition, normal\npressure hydrocephalus (NPH). In infants with hydrocephalus, CSF builds up in\nthe central nervous system, causing the fontanelle to bulge and the head to be\nlarger than expected.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Early symptoms may also\ninclude downward gaze, irritability, seizures, sleepiness, vomiting, and\nspasticity of the extremities.&nbsp;\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Hydrocephalus\ncan be caused by impaired CSF flow, impaired CSF reabsorption, or excessive CSF\nproduction.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  &middot;\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  The\nmost common cause of hydrocephalus is CSF flow obstruction, hindering the free\npassage of cerebrospinal fluid through the ventricular system and subarachnoid\nspace (e.g., stenosis of the cerebral aqueduct or obstruction of the\ninterventricular foramina secondary to tumor, hemorrhage, infection, or\ncongenital malformation).\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <img alt=\"Description: csf\" border=\"0\" height=\"271\" id=\"Picture 347377\" src=\"static/img/tutorials/image267.png\" width=\"243\"/>\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  &middot;\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Hydrocephalus\ncan also be caused by overproduction of cerebrospinal fluid (e.g., papilloma of\nchoroid plexus). The choroid plexus consists of a layer of cuboidal epithelial\ncells surrounding a core of capillaries and loose connective tissue. The\nepithelial layer is continuous with the ependymal cell layer that lines the\nventricles, but unlike the ependyma, the choroid plexus layer has tight\njunctions in between cells on the side facing the ventricle (apical surface).\nThese tight junctions prevent the majority of substances from crossing the cell\nlayer into the CSF; thus, the choroid plexus acts as a blood-CSF barrier. The\nchoroid plexus folds into many villi around each capillary, creating frond-like\nprocesses that project into the ventricles. These villi greatly increase the\nsurface area of the choroid plexus. CSF is formed as plasma is filtered from\nthe blood through the epithelial cells. In addition to CSF production, the\nchoroid plexus acts as a filtration system, removing metabolic waste, foreign\nsubstances, and excess neurotransmitters. In this way, the choroid plexus has\nan important role in helping to maintain the delicate extracellular environment\nrequired by the brain to function optimally.\n </span>\n</p>\n", "question": "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  A\n4-month-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother for a well-child\nexamination.

The triptans work by\nbinding to serotonin 5-HT receptors in nerve endings and on cranial blood\nvessels (causing vasoconstriction). They are most effective when taken at the\nbeginning of a migraine. The safety of triptans is well established, and the\nrisk of coronary vasospasm is exceedingly rare. Still, triptans should not be\ntaken by patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease, as they may\nincrease risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Migraine prophylaxis should\nbe considered in patients with frequent or prolonged headaches.

The most likely diagnosis in a 34-year\nold woman is multiple sclerosis. Multiple sclerosis is a demyelinating disease\nthat, by definition, affects more than one CNS site. (Myelin is a substance\nthat provides &ldquo;electrical insulation.&rdquo; It forms a layer, the myelin sheath,\nwhich is usually around only the axon of a neuron. Schwann cells supply the\nmyelin for peripheral neurons, whereas oligodendrocytes myelinate the axons of\nthe central nervous system.) Demyelination of the optic nerve (optic neuritis)\nexplains the visual findings and demyelination of the spinal cord explains the\nlower extremity findings. The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis requires the\npresence of multiple CNS lesions, a history of relapse and remission,\ninvolvement of white matter, and exclusion of other diagnoses. The most common\ncause of optic neuritis is multiple sclerosis. Up to 50% of patients with\nmultiple sclerosis will develop optic neuritis, and in 20-30% of cases, optic\nneuritis is the presenting sign.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"row\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\"row text-center\"><h4>Tutorial</h4></div>\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  The\npathway for the pupillary light reflex begins in the retina (Figure 6-2). The\naxons from the retinal ganglion cell (RET) run through the optic nerve (ON),\noptic chiasm (CHI), and optic tract (OT). They synapse in the pretectal nucleus\n(PTN) of the midbrain at the level of the oculomotor nerve. Fibers then run\nfrom the pretectal nucleus to both Edinger-Westphal nuclei (EWN) of the\noculomotor nerve complex. The nerve fibers from the Edinger-Westphal nuclei run\nin the oculomotor nerve to the ciliary ganglion (CG) and then through short\nciliary nerves to the iris sphincter.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  When light\nis directed into one eye, the information regarding light brightness is\nsummated in the pretectal region of the midbrain. That information goes to both\nEdinger-Westphal nuclei equally. Consequently, both pupils constrict equally\nwhen a bright light is directed into one eye. If for some reason (e.g., optic\nnerve lesion, retinal detachment, opacified cornea), less light is &ldquo;conveyed&rdquo;\nthrough the optic nerve, the pretectal region will detect this, both\nEdinger-Westphal nuclei will receive less input, and the pupillary response\nwill be bilaterally sluggish or absent. However, when light is projected into\nthe normal eye, both pupils will constrict briskly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  In this\nvignette, light directed into the right eye causes both pupils to react\nsluggishly, whereas light directed into the left eye causes both pupils to\nconstrict briskly. The efferent arc (oculomotor nerve) of the light reflex is,\ntherefore, normal. The lesion must be in the afferent limb of the reflex arc.\nFibers carrying information on light brightness cross at the optic chiasm.\nSince the patient has a uniocular deficit, the lesion must be anterior to the\noptic chiasm. This afferent pupillary defect is called the Marcus Gunn\npupillary sign. Because the cornea, lens, ocular media, and macula appear\nnormal, the lesion must be in the optic nerve.&nbsp;\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Lower\nextremity findings include right-sided weakness and left-sided loss of pinprick\nand temperature sensation (Figure 6-4). These findings are consistent with a\nlesion in the right half of the spinal cord. Such a lesion would affect\ncorticospinal fibers to the right lower extremity and spinothalamic fibers from\nthe left lower extremity. If the dorsal columns were involved, loss of\nvibratory sensation and proprioception would be present on the ipsilateral\nside. Because the lower, but not the upper, extremities are affected, the\nlesion must be caudal to T1 and rostral to L2 (spinal levels). (The upper\nextremities are innervated by spinal nerves C5 to T1; the lower extremities are\ninnervated by spinal nerves L2 to S1.

An action potential\nis an electrical current that travels down a nerve fiber. An action potential\ncan occur only when opposite charges exist on two sides of a cell membrane.\nNerve fibers are positively charged on the outside and negatively charged on\nthe inside. An action potential represents a brief reversal of that charge\n(positive on the inside and negative on the outside) as it travels down the\nnerve fiber.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Neurons\nuse Na\n  <sup>\n   +\n  </sup>\n  and K\n  <sup>\n   +\n  </sup>\n  to maintain polarity. Na\n  <sup>\n   +\n  </sup>\n  is\nhighly concentrated outside the cell and K\n  <sup>\n   +\n  </sup>\n  is highly concentrated\ninside the cell. When a nerve is resting (not transmitting an electrical message),\nNa\n  <sup>\n   +\n  </sup>\n  and K\n  <sup>\n   +\n  </sup>\n  move down their concentration gradients\nthrough\n  <i>\n   potassium-sodium leak channels\n  </i>\n  to opposite sides of the\nmembrane. These leak channels are always open. Na\n  <sup>\n   +\n  </sup>\n  travels from\noutside to inside the nerve, and K\n  <sup>\n   +\n  </sup>\n  travels from inside to outside\nthe nerve. This continuous process is possible because the cell membrane\ncontains a\n  <i>\n   Na\n   <sup>\n    +\n   </sup>\n   /K\n   <sup>\n    +\n   </sup>\n   ATPase\n  </i>\n  <i>\n   pump\n  </i>\n  , which\nreturns Na\n  <sup>\n   +\n  </sup>\n  and K\n  <sup>\n   +\n  </sup>\n  to their original positions.

For every 3 Na\n  <sup>\n   +\n  </sup>\n  pumped out of the cell, 2 K\n  <sup>\n   +\n  </sup>\n  are pumped in. This 3-to-2 discrepancy\nallows the inside of the neuron to be negatively charged relative to the\noutside.

OCD is characterized by obsessive thoughts and/or\nrepetitive compulsive actions. Obsessions are recurrent and persistent thoughts\nthat are intrusive, inappropriate, and not merely excessive worries about\nreal-life problems.

(Acetylcholine\nstimulates muscarinic receptors, causing pupillary constriction.) At first,\nthis seems like a plausible explanation for the small left pupil. But\ncholinesterase inhibition would not explain the failure of tyramine to produce\npupillary dilation.

In the normal operation of the autonomic\nnervous system, action potentials cause neurons to release their\nneurotransmitters.&nbsp; Following release, the neurotransmitters interact with\nreceptors on the effector to produce a response, in this instance contraction\nor dilation of the pupil.&nbsp; Pupillary responses can be used to predict the\neffects of agonists or antagonists of autonomic receptors.&nbsp;\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <b>\n  Pupillary diameter\n </b>\n is\ndetermined by a balance of parasympathetic and sympathetic activation.&nbsp;\nThe parasympathetic control dominates under most conditions.&nbsp; Increasing\nparasympathetic activity will produce enhanced pupillary constriction and\ndecreasing parasympathetic activity will produce pupillary dilation.&nbsp; The\nreverse is true for decreasing and increasing sympathetic activity,\nrespectively.&nbsp; Therefore, pupillary dilation can be elicited in two ways:\nblockade of muscarinic receptors or excitation of alpha\n <sub>\n  1\n </sub>\n receptors.&nbsp; Drugs that produce either one of these effects are used to\ndilate eyes for an ophthalmological exam.&nbsp; Analogously, pupillary\nconstriction can be elicited by exciting muscarinic receptors or blocking alpha\n <sub>\n  1\n </sub>\n receptors.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n Administration of a drug\nthat stimulates alpha\n <sub>\n  1\n </sub>\n receptors, such as norepinephrine or epinephrine,\nwill produce pupillary dilation; a drug that stimulates muscarinic receptors\nwill produce pupillary constriction.&nbsp; These effects will occur regardless\nof whether the autonomic nervous system is intact because the drugs bypass the\nnervous system to act directly on the receptors.&nbsp; Tyramine is a drug that\nproduces sympathoexcitation by causing the release of norepinephrine from\nsympathetic postganglionic nerve terminals.&nbsp; It does this by displacing\nnorepinephrine from the storage vesicles.&nbsp; Because tyramine must act\nthrough the sympathetic nervous system, it is classified as an indirect\nsympathomimetic drug.&nbsp; If there is damage to sympathetic postganglionic\nneurons so that they are not functional or do not contain norepinephrine in\nvesicles, then tyramine will not have an effect.&nbsp; If this situation\noccurs, administration of norepinephrine or epinephrine can still have an\neffect because they do not require the presence of an intact sympathetic\nnervous system to produce an effect.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n In this vignette, the left\npupil is smaller than the right.

Contrary to expectation, however, treatment with tyramine has no\neffect on left pupillary size. Normally, tyramine should stimulate neuronal\nrelease of norepinephrine, causing pupillary dilation. If this is not\nhappening, the neuron must be dysfunctional. Nerves that release norepinephrine\nbelong to the sympathetic nervous system; therefore, sympathetic denervation\nwould explain the inability of the nerves to release norepinephrine in response\nto tyramine.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n In other words, epinephrine\nis effective because it stimulates the &alpha;\n <sub>\n  1\n </sub>\n adrenergic receptor\n <i>\n  directly\n </i>\n .\nTyramine works\n <i>\n  indirectly\n </i>\n by stimulating the sympathetic nerves to\nrelease norepinephrine.

The most common and dramatic is\nthe generalized convulsion, also called the\n  <span>\n   grand-mal seizure\n  </span>\n  . In\nthis type of seizure, the patient loses consciousness and usually collapses.\nThe loss of consciousness is followed by generalized body stiffening (called\nthe &ldquo;tonic&rdquo; phase of the seizure) for 30 to 60 seconds, then by violent jerking\n(the &ldquo;clonic&rdquo; phase) for 30 to 60 seconds, after which the patient goes into a\ndeep sleep (the &ldquo;postictal&rdquo; or after-seizure phase). During grand-mal seizures,\ninjuries and accidents may occur, such as tongue biting and urinary\nincontinence.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Absence\nseizures\n </span>\n <span>\n  cause a short loss of consciousness (just a few seconds) with few or no\nsymptoms.

Motor symptoms include movements such as jerking\nand stiffening. Sensory symptoms involve unusual sensations affecting any of\nthe five senses (vision, hearing, smell, taste, or touch). When simple partial\nseizures cause sensory symptoms only (and not motor symptoms), they are called\n\"auras.\" Autonomic symptoms include nausea, diarrhea, incontinence,\nand tachycardia.

Especially\nsusceptible are the muscles that control eye and eyelid movements, facial\nexpression, chewing, talking, and swallowing. Presenting symptoms include\nptosis, diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, and change in facial expression. Neck\nand limb movements may be affected, gait may be unsteady, and breathing may be\nimpaired.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <b>\n  <span>\n   Multiple\nsclerosis\n  </span>\n </b>\n <span>\n  .\nMultiple sclerosis is an inflammatory disease in which the myelin sheaths\naround the axons of the brain and spinal cord are damaged, leading to\ndemyelination and scarring. (The myelin sheath is usually around only the axon\nof a neuron. Schwann cells supply the myelin for peripheral neurons, whereas\noligodendrocytes myelinate the axons of the central nervous system.) Multiple\nsclerosis usually begins in young adults. Women are more commonly affected than\nmen. Patients can have almost any neurological finding,&nbsp; including\nfatigue, visual changes, altered sensation, pain, muscle weakness, difficulty\nwith movement or balance, problems with speech or swallowing, and bowel or\nbladder dysfunction. Cognitive and mood changes may occur. Uhthoff&rsquo;s phenomenon\n(exacerbation of symptoms with exposure to heat) and Lhermitte&rsquo;s sign (an\nelectrical sensation running down the back when bending the neck) are\ncharacteristic but not specific for multiple sclerosis. Symptoms may progress\ngradually or alternate between relapse and remission.&nbsp;\n  <sup>\n   &nbsp;\n  </sup>\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <b>\n  <span>\n   Guillain-Barr&eacute;\nsyndrome\n  </span>\n </b>\n <span>\n  .\nGuillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome is an\n  <span>\n   acute inflammatory demyelinating\npolyneuropathy\n  </span>\n  (AIDP), an autoimmune disorder affecting the peripehral\nnervous system, usually triggered by an acute infectious process.

The\nfirst-order neuron has its cell body in the trigeminal nerve ganglion. Its\ndendrites are sensory receptors and its axon enters the spinal trigeminal\nnucleus, which extends from the upper pons to the C2 level of the spinal cord.\nSecond-order neurons, whose cell bodies lie in the spinal trigeminal nucleus,\nsend their axons to the contralateral side, where they ascend in the\ncontralateral medial lemniscus and synapse with the third-order neurons in the\nthalamus. The third-order neurons send their neurons to the somatosensory\ncortex in the parietal lobe. A lesion anywhere along this pathway can decrease\npain and temperature sensation on the right side of the face and cause a loss\nof the corneal reflex.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Decreased\npain and temperature sensation on the left side of the body indicates involvement\nof the spinothalamic tract. The only place where the spinothalamic tract\nreceiving input from the left side of the body approximates the trigeminal\nsystem from the right side of the body is in the right brainstem between the\nupper pons and C2 (These are the upper and lower limits of the spinal\ntrigeminal nucleus).&nbsp;\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Hoarseness\nand an abnormal gag reflex further localize the lesion (Figure 5-3). Hoarseness\nis caused by vocal cord dysfunction. The vocal cords are innervated by the\nvagus nerve from the nucleus ambiguus. The gag reflex involves cranial nerves\nIX and X. The afferent limb is supplied by the glossopharyngeal nerve and the\nefferent limb is supplied by the vagus nerve. Thus, dysfunction of the nucleus\nambiguus and the vagus nerve on the right side will cause hoarseness and right\npalatal paralysis. The nucleus ambiguus is located in the upper medulla.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  The\npatient has clumsiness and incoordination. These could be due to loss of\nposition sense, weakness, vestibular dysfunction, or cerebellar dysfunction.\nThe findings of ataxia (gross lack of coordination), dysmetria (inability to\njudge distance with the water hose), and intention tremor (right hand shaking\nwhen holding the water hose, but not at rest) suggest ipsilateral cerebellar\ndysfunction. We already suspect a lesion in the upper medulla due to the\npatient&rsquo;s hoarseness and palatal paralysis. The inferior cerebellar peduncle is\nlocated in the upper medulla; therefore, a lesion in the upper medulla could\nexplain the cerebellar findings (Figure 5-4).&nbsp;\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  The\npatient also has vertigo, nausea, and nystagmus, which suggest vestibular\ndysfunction. Vestibular input is conveyed from the labyrinth of the inner ear\nto the vestibular nucleus in the lower pons and upper medulla.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Romberg&rsquo;s\nsign is absent. This sign is elicited by asking the patient to stand with his\nfeet together and with his eyes open, and then closed. If unsteadiness\nincreases when the eyes are closed, the patient is said to have Romberg&rsquo;s sign,\nwhich suggests proprioceptive or vestibular dysfunction. If unsteadiness does\nnot change, Romberg sign is said to be absent. Cerebellar dysfunction is\nassociated with an absent Romberg sign: Unsteadiness is equally severe with the\neyes opened and closed.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Finally,\nthe patient has Horner&rsquo;s syndrome &ndash; ptosis, miosis, and hemifacial\nanhidrosis &ndash; which indicates dysfunction of the sympathetic nervous\nsystem.

Therefore, a lower motor neuron lesion\nwould result in loss of innervation to the upper and lower face. This is known\nas a &ldquo;peripheral&rdquo; type of facial weakness.

This is an example of &ldquo;crossed paralysis&rdquo; in which there is cranial nerve\nweakness on one side of the body and extremity weakness on the other side.\nCrossed paralysis indicates a brainstem lesion. The slurred speech is caused by\nfacial weakness. (Certain sounds like &ldquo;me&rdquo; and &ldquo;pa&rdquo; require closure of the\nobicularis oris, which is affected in facial paralysis.)\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  The system\ninvolved in moving the eyes conjugately to the left originates in the right\nfrontal eye field of the cerebral cortex (Figure 2-5). Fibers descend through\nthe internal capsule to the right side of the midbrain. Here, fibers cross to\nthe left side at the level of the lower midbrain. These fibers then descend to\nthe lower pontine level and synapse in an area called the paramedian pontine\nreticular formation (PPRF). Fibers then leave the PPRF and synapse in the\nipsilateral abducens nucleus. There are two populations of neurons in the\nabducens nucleus: motor neurons, which run to the lateral rectus muscle to\nabduct the ipsilateral eye, and interneurons, which cross the midline at the\nlevel of the abducens nucleus to ascend in the contralateral medial\nlongitudinal fasciculus (MLF) and synapse in the medial rectus subnucleus of\nthe oculomotor nucleus. When the PPRF activates the abducens nucleus, the eyes\nmove conjugately to the ipsilateral side by innervating the ipsilateral lateral\nrectus and contralateral medial rectus muscles. A lesion of the PPRF or closely\nadjacent abducens nucleus produces horizontal gaze palsy when the patient tries\nto look toward the side of the lesion (as in this case).&nbsp;\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  In this\nvignette, we have established that the lesion is in the left pons, because of\nthe presence of left facial weakness and right upper and lower extremity\nweakness.

In the pyramids of the medulla, it crosses to the right side and descends\nin the right lateral funiculus of the spinal cord. The corticospinal fibers\nsynapse with second-order neurons in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. Axons\nof these neurons innervate muscles on the right side of the body.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Numbness\nin the left upper and lower extremities suggests involvement of the\nspinothalamic tract (Figure 1-3). This is confirmed by the absence of pinprick\nand temperature sensation on the left side.&nbsp; The first-order neuron has\nits cell body in the dorsal root ganglion and enters the spinal cord via the dorsal\nroot. It synapses with the second-order neuron in the dorsal horn of the spinal\ncord. The second-order neuron then crosses to the other side of the spinal cord\nthrough the anterior white commissure. It ascends in the lateral funiculus to\nsynapse in the ventral posterior lateral nucleus of the thalamus. From there,\nthe third-order neuron ascends to the somatosensory area of the cerebral\ncortex.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  The only\nanatomic site where a single small lesion can affect both the corticospinal and\nspinothalamic tracts and produce the symptoms seen in this patient is on the\nright side below the pyramidal decussation and above the C5 level of the spinal\ncord.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  The\nascending fibers in the spinal cord are laminated such that fibers entering\nfrom the lower levels are more lateral and superficial. These fibers are more\nvulnerable to compression by an extrinsic lesion. As an extrinsic lesion\nexpands, more fibers are involved and the sensory symptoms appear to ascend.\nFibers of the corticospinal system are similarly laminated, and progressive\nspinal cord compression can cause an ascending pattern of weakness. (This\npattern is sometimes confused with the ascending symptoms of Guillain-Barr&eacute;\nsyndrome.)\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Vibratory\nand proprioceptive sensation is mediated by the dorsal column-medial lemniscal\npathway (Figure 1-4). The first-order neuron, whose cell body is in the dorsal\nroot ganglion, enters the spinal cord via the dorsal root. It ascends in the\nipsilateral dorsal column of the spinal cord without synapsing or crossing to\nthe other side. In the medulla, the first-order neurons from spinal segments\nbelow T6 synapse in the nucleus gracilis, while those from rostral spinal\nsegments synapse in the nucleus cuneatus. The second-order neuron axons cross\nto the other side to form the medial lemniscus. These fibers then ascend to\nsynapse with the third-order neurons in the thalamus.

This number is an estimate of the truth rather than the truth itself\nbecause each study, however large, includes only a sample of all the people who\nare affected by the exposure-outcome relationship. The point estimate expresses\nthe strength of the association between the exposure and outcome. In an RCT or\na cohort study, the point estimate is the\n  <b>\n   relative risk\n  </b>\n  (RR). Risk in\nthe study subjects is the number of cases or outcomes that occur over time. The\nRR is simply the risk of disease (or other outcome) among the exposed or\ntreated subjects divided by the risk in the unexposed subjects. A case-control\nstudy does not measure risk directly but calculates its results as an\n  <span class=\"apple-converted-space\">\n   &nbsp;\n  </span>\n  <b>\n   odds ratio\n  </b>\n  <span class=\"apple-converted-space\">\n   &nbsp;\n  </span>\n  (OR), which is generally equivalent to\nan RR from a cohort study\n  <a name=\"4-u1.0-B978-0-323-06986-1..00005-6--t001\">\n  </a>\n  .\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n <table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"\">\n  <tr>\n   <td valign=\"top\">\n    <p class=\"\">\n     <span>\n      RRs and ORs &lt; 1.0\n  indicate protection from outcome.\n     </span>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td valign=\"top\">\n    <p class=\"\">\n     <span>\n      RRs and ORs &gt; 1.0\n  indicate risk of outcome.\n     </span>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td valign=\"top\">\n    <p class=\"\">\n     <span>\n      RRs and ORs = 1.0\n  indicate no association to outcome.\n     </span>\n    </p>\n   </td>\n  </tr>\n </table>\n</div>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  If\nthere is no association at all between the exposure and outcome, then the RR or\nOR would be 1.0.

The\nquantitative description of the study results needs to include a measure of\nthis uncertainty. The\n  <b>\n   confidence interval\n  </b>\n  is widely used to express the\nprecision of the point estimate; a wide confidence interval indicates less\nprecision, and a narrow confidence interval indicates more. In general, the\nlarger the study, the narrower the confidence interval. There are several\ncautions about interpreting confidence intervals correctly. First, the\nconfidence interval indicates only uncertainty that is due to the play of\nchance; it does not inform us about uncertainty in the results because of other\nfactors, such as confounders that have not been controlled for, or of\npeculiarities of the population that was studied, or poor study quality.\nSecond, a wide confidence interval does not mean there is no association\nbetween the exposure\n </span>\n <span>\n  and the outcome; even an imprecise point\nestimate remains the best explanation of\n </span>\n <span>\n  the relationship until a larger or better study is\nperformed. Finally, confidence intervals are often drawn as a straight line\naround the point estimate to show the width of their range; this might seem to\nsuggest that the location of the true point estimate would be equally likely to\nfall anywhere within that interval. In fact, the confidence interval could\nbetter be shown as a bell-shaped curve centered on the point estimate.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n <span>\n  Relative\nrisk estimates do not take into account the incidence or the importance of the\nproblem being evaluated. A relative risk of 4 says that the outcome increases\n400% in exposed individuals compared with unexposed individuals. This increase\noften causes great worry or excitement (particularly in the media). However,\nthe relative risk must be interpreted in the context of the frequency of the\noutcome. For instance, the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in young\nwomen without using oral contraceptives is about 1 in 10,000, and the incidence\nwhile using oral contraceptives is 4 in 10,000; thus, the relative risk is 4.\nHowever, the\n  <b>\n   absolute risk\n  </b>\n  of VTE is still low in both groups of women\nwith a difference in risk of 3 in 10,000. The risk in the exposed minus the\nrisk in the unexposed is the risk difference. The\n  <span class=\"apple-converted-space\">\n   &nbsp;\n  </span>\n  <i>\n   risk difference\n  </i>\n  <span class=\"apple-converted-space\">\n   &nbsp;\n  </span>\n  describes the size of the effect in\nabsolute terms.

An\nalternative calculation looks at the complementary concept: how many patients\nneed to be treated to observe one benefit or one adverse event? The\n  <span class=\"apple-converted-space\">\n   &nbsp;\n  </span>\n  <b>\n   number needed to treat (NNT)\n  </b>\n  ,\nthe number of patients who need to be treated to achieve an additional positive\noutcome, is the reciprocal of the\n  <b>\n   absolute risk reduction\n  </b>\n  (the risk\ndifference for good outcomes). If the effect is dangerous, the value is called\nthe\n  <b>\n   number needed to harm (NNH)\n  </b>\n  . The number of patients who, if they\nreceived the treatment, would lead to one additional patient being harmed,\ncompared with patients not receiving the treatment, is the reciprocal of the\nabsolute risk increase (the risk difference for bad outcomes). Thus, using the\nexample of oral contraceptives, with a risk of VTE of 4 in 10,000, the number\nneeded to harm (NNH)&mdash;that is, to experience one extra VTE&mdash;is 3333,\nthe reciprocal of 3 in 10,000, which is the\n  <b>\n   absolute risk increase\n  </b>\n  .\n </span>\n</p>\n", "question": "<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  Which of the following represents the precision of\nthe estimate of the association between the exposure and outcome in a harm\nstudy?\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  A.\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Relative risk\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  B.\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Absolute\nrisk increase\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  C.\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Confidence\ninterval\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  D.\n  <span>\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;\n  </span>\n </span>\n <span>\n  Number-needed-to-harm\n </span>\n</p>\n"}, {"answer": "<p class=\"\">\n <b>\n  <span>\n   Answer\nE is correct.\n  </span>\n </b>\n <span>\n  A\ncorrelation coefficient of +0.9 indicates a strong positive correlation between\nthe VAS and VRS for measuring pain intensity.\n  <b>\n   &nbsp;\n  </b>\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<div class=\"row\">&nbsp;</div><div class=\"row text-center\"><h4>Tutorial</h4></div>\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  The\n  <span>\n   correlation\ncoefficient\n  </span>\n  (r) measures the strength and direction of a linear\nrelationship between two variables.&nbsp;The correlation coefficient ranges\nfrom &minus;1 to +1. &nbsp;\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <br/>\n  <i>\n   Positive correlation\n  </i>\n  <span>\n   :\n  </span>\n  &nbsp;&nbsp; If\n  <span>\n   x\n  </span>\n  and\n  <span>\n   y\n  </span>\n  have a strong positive linear correlation,\n  <span>\n   r\n  </span>\n  is close to +1.&nbsp;\nAn\n  <span>\n   r\n  </span>\n  <span>\n  </span>\n  value of exactly +1 indicates a perfect positive\nfit.&nbsp;Positive values indicate that as\n  <span>\n   x\n  </span>\n  increases,\n  <span>\n   y\n  </span>\n  also\nincreases.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <br/>\n  <i>\n   Negative correlation\n  </i>\n  <span>\n   :\n  </span>\n  &nbsp; If\n  <span>\n   x\n  </span>\n  and\n  <span>\n   y\n  </span>\n  have a strong negative linear correlation,\n  <span>\n   r\n  </span>\n  is close to\n&minus;1.&nbsp; An\n  <span>\n   r\n  </span>\n  <span>\n  </span>\n  value of exactly &minus;1\nindicates a perfect negative fit.&nbsp;Negative values indicate that as\n  <span>\n   x\n  </span>\n  increases,\n  <span>\n   y\n  </span>\n  decreases.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <i>\n  <span>\n   No\ncorrelation\n  </span>\n </i>\n <span>\n  :\n </span>\n <span>\n  &nbsp; If there is no\nlinear correlation between x and y,\n  <span>\n   r\n  </span>\n  is 0.&nbsp; A value of zero\nmeans that there is a random, nonlinear relationship between the two variables.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  <br/>\n  A\n  <span>\n   perfect\n  </span>\n  correlation of +1 or &minus;1 occurs only when all data\npoints lie exactly on a straight line.&nbsp; If\n  <span>\n   r\n  </span>\n  is +1, the slope\nof the line is positive.&nbsp; If\n  <span>\n   r\n  </span>\n  is &minus;1, the slope of the\nline is negative.&nbsp;\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  A\ncorrelation greater than 0.8 is generally considered &ldquo;\n  <span>\n   strong\n  </span>\n  &rdquo;; a\ncorrelation less than 0.5 is generally considered &ldquo;\n  <span>\n   weak\n  </span>\n  .&rdquo;&nbsp;\n(This depends, however, on the type of data being examined.)\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\" class=\"\">\n <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Correlation_examples.png\">\n  <span>\n   <img alt=\"Description: 400px-Correlation_examples\" border=\"0\" height=\"128\" id=\"Picture 347418\" src=\"static/img/tutorials/image328.png\" width=\"302\"/>\n  </span>\n </a>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  The figure\nabove shows several sets of data (\n  <i>\n   x\n  </i>\n  ,&nbsp;\n  <i>\n   y\n  </i>\n  ) points, with the\ncorrelation coefficient listed above each set.

Understanding drug metabolism can clarify the issue.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  A basic\npurpose of drug metabolism is to make drugs water-soluble so they can be\nexcreted in the urine or bile. Many drugs are metabolized by the cytochrome\nP450 (CYP) system of enzymes, which predominate in the liver. Such drugs are\nconsidered &ldquo;substrates&rdquo; of the CYP system. In addition, many drugs can induce\nor inhibit the enzymes. &ldquo;Inducers&rdquo; will accelerate the metabolism of a\nsubstrate, while &ldquo;inhibitors&rdquo; will interfere with metabolism. If a patient\nreceives a CYP &ldquo;substrate&rdquo; and a CYP &ldquo;inhibitor&rdquo; concomitantly, enzyme\ninhibition will cause the level of the substrate to rise. If a patient receives\na CYP &ldquo;substrate&rdquo; and a CYP &ldquo;inducer&rdquo; concomitantly, enzyme induction will\ncause the level of the substrate to fall.\n </span>\n</p>\n\n<p class=\"\">\n <span>\n  In this\ncase, amitriptyline is a substrate for CYP and paroxetine is an inhibitor of\nCYP.

Disease progression can result\nin liver failure, which may be manifested by jaundice, elevated transaminases,\nhypoglycemia, acidosis, easy bruising, and encephalopathy. Some patients\nimprove spontaneously; others progress; some ultimately die. Liver damage is\nnot caused by the acetaminophen itself, but by a metabolite,\n <i>\n  N\n </i>\n -acetyl-\n <i>\n  p\n </i>\n -benzoquinoneimine\n(NAPQI), which depletes the liver&rsquo;s natural antioxidant, glutathione. Risk\nfactors for acetaminophen toxicity include excessive alcohol intake, fasting or\nanorexia nervosa, and use of certain drugs such as isoniazid. Treatment\nincludes removing acetaminophen from the body and replacing the depleted\nglutathione.
